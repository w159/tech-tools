# Design Handoff

Create clear, complete handoff documentation so developers can implement designs accurately.

## What to Include

### Visual Specifications
- Exact measurements (padding, margins, widths)
- Design token references (colors, typography, spacing)
- Responsive breakpoints and behavior
- Component variants and states

### Interaction Specifications
- Click/tap behavior
- Hover states
- Transitions and animations (duration, easing)
- Gesture support (swipe, pinch, long-press)

### Content Specifications
- Character limits
- Truncation behavior
- Empty states
- Loading states
- Error states

### Edge Cases
- Minimum/maximum content
- International text (longer strings)
- Slow connections
- Missing data

### Accessibility
- Focus order
- ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard interactions
- Screen reader announcements

## Principles

1. **Don't assume** - If it's not specified, the developer will guess. Specify everything.
2. **Use tokens, not values** - Reference `spacing-md` not `16px`.
3. **Show all states** - Default, hover, active, disabled, loading, error, empty.
4. **Describe the why** - "This collapses on mobile because users primarily use one-handed" helps developers make good judgment calls.
