Get structured design feedback across multiple dimensions. See the **design-critique** skill for the evaluation framework and feedback principles.

## Usage

```
/critique $ARGUMENTS
```

Review the design: @$1

If a Figma URL is provided, pull the design from Figma. If a file is referenced, read it. Otherwise, ask the user to describe or share their design.

## What I Need From You

- **The design**: Figma URL, screenshot, or detailed description
- **Context**: What is this? Who is it for? What stage (exploration, refinement, final)?
- **Focus** (optional): "Focus on mobile" or "Focus on the onboarding flow"

## Output

```markdown
## Design Critique: [Design Name]

### Overall Impression
[1-2 sentence first reaction - what works, what's the biggest opportunity]

### Usability
| Finding | Severity | Recommendation |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| [Issue] | [Critical] / [Moderate] / [Minor] | [Fix] |

### Visual Hierarchy
- **What draws the eye first**: [Element] - [Is this correct?]
- **Reading flow**: [How does the eye move through the layout?]
- **Emphasis**: [Are the right things emphasized?]

### Consistency
| Element | Issue | Recommendation |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| [Typography/spacing/color] | [Inconsistency] | [Fix] |

### Accessibility
- **Color contrast**: [Pass/fail for key text]
- **Touch targets**: [Adequate size?]
- **Text readability**: [Font size, line height]

### What Works Well
- [Positive observation 1]
- [Positive observation 2]

### Priority Recommendations
1. **[Most impactful change]** - [Why and how]
2. **[Second priority]** - [Why and how]
3. **[Third priority]** - [Why and how]
```

## If Connectors Available

If **~~design tool** is connected:
- Pull the design directly from Figma and inspect components, tokens, and layers
- Compare against the existing design system for consistency

If **~~user feedback** is connected:
- Cross-reference design decisions with recent user feedback and support tickets

## Tips

1. **Share the context** - "This is a checkout flow for a B2B SaaS" helps me give relevant feedback.
2. **Specify your stage** - Early exploration gets different feedback than final polish.
3. **Ask me to focus** - "Just look at the navigation" gives you more depth on one area.
