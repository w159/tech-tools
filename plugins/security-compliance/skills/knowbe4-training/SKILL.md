# KnowBe4 Training Campaign Management

## Overview

KnowBe4 training campaigns deliver security awareness content to users through structured enrollment workflows. Training can be assigned manually, triggered automatically after phishing test failures, or scheduled on a recurring basis. Each campaign tracks enrollment status, completion rates, and compliance deadlines. The training content library includes interactive modules, videos, games, assessments, and policy documents.

## Key Concepts

### Training Campaign Lifecycle

```
CREATED --> SCHEDULED --> ACTIVE --> CLOSED
                |                       |
                +---- CANCELLED         +--> ARCHIVED
```

- **Created**: Campaign configured with content and target groups
- **Scheduled**: Queued to begin enrollment at a future date
- **Active**: Users enrolled and training in progress
- **Closed**: Campaign deadline passed, final completion recorded
- **Cancelled**: Campaign aborted
- **Archived**: Closed campaign moved to archive

### Enrollment Statuses

| Status | Description | Business Meaning |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **Not Started** | User enrolled but has not begun | Needs reminder |
| **In Progress** | User has started but not completed | Actively working |
| **Completed** | User finished all required content | Compliant |
| **Past Due** | Deadline passed without completion | Non-compliant |

### Training Content Types

| Type | Description | Typical Duration |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Training Module** | Interactive course with slides and quizzes | 15-45 minutes |
| **Video** | Pre-recorded security awareness video | 5-15 minutes |
| **Game** | Gamified security training | 10-20 minutes |
| **Assessment** | Knowledge check quiz | 5-10 minutes |
| **Policy** | Policy document requiring acknowledgment | 2-5 minutes |
| **Newsletter** | Security awareness newsletter | 3-5 minutes |
| **Poster** | Downloadable awareness poster | N/A |

### Auto-Enrollment Triggers

Training can be triggered automatically based on:

| Trigger | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Phishing Failure** | User clicked/failed a phishing test |
| **New Hire** | User added to the system |
| **Group Membership** | User added to a specific group |
| **Scheduled** | Recurring enrollment (monthly, quarterly, annually) |
| **Manager Request** | Manual enrollment by manager/admin |

Note: the connected KnowBe4 Reporting API does not expose a training module catalog. Module and course selection happens in the KnowBe4 console.

## Common Workflows

### Create and Monitor Training Campaign

1. **Review existing training campaigns** using `knowbe4_training_campaigns_list` (module catalog is managed in the KnowBe4 console)
2. **Select target groups** - choose which user groups need training
3. **Set completion deadline** - allow adequate time (2-4 weeks typical)
4. **Launch campaign** - schedule or start immediately
5. **Monitor enrollment status** - check completion rates weekly
6. **Send reminders** to users with "not_started" or "in_progress" status
7. **Review final completion** after deadline

### Track Compliance Status

1. **List active campaigns** with `knowbe4_training_campaigns_list`
2. **Get enrollments** for each campaign
3. **Filter by status** to find incomplete/past_due enrollments
4. **Identify non-compliant users** - group by department or manager
5. **Escalate** users who are past due on required training

### Post-Phishing Remediation Training

1. **Identify failed users** from phishing campaign results
2. **Find appropriate remedial module** matching the phishing scenario
3. **Create targeted campaign** for failed users only
4. **Set short deadline** (1 week for remediation)
5. **Track completion** and re-test with follow-up phishing simulation

### Quarterly Security Awareness Review

1. **Pull all completed campaigns** for the quarter
2. **Calculate overall completion rate** across all campaigns
3. **Identify departments** with lowest completion rates
4. **Review training content** - are modules current and relevant?
5. **Plan next quarter** based on gaps identified

### New Hire Onboarding

1. **Create onboarding training campaign** with essential modules
2. **Enable auto-enrollment** for the "New Hires" group
3. **Set relative deadline** (e.g., 14 days from enrollment)
4. **Include baseline phishing test** after training completion
5. **Move to regular groups** after onboarding completion

## Error Handling

### Common API Errors

| Code | Message | Resolution |
|------|---------|------------|
| 400 | Invalid campaign configuration | Verify content IDs and group IDs exist |
| 401 | Invalid API token | Verify KNOWBE4_API_KEY |
| 403 | Insufficient permissions | API token needs Training permissions |
| 404 | Campaign not found | Verify campaign_id exists |
| 404 | Enrollment not found | Verify enrollment_id exists |
| 429 | Rate limit exceeded | Implement backoff (see api-patterns) |

### Data Considerations

| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Zero completion rate | Campaign just started | Allow time for users to complete |
| User not enrolled | Not in target group | Check group membership |
| Completion not recording | Module requires assessment pass | User may need to retake quiz |
| Past due but completed | Completed after deadline | Marked past_due at deadline, then completed |
| Duplicate enrollments | Multiple campaigns with same content | Check `allow_multiple_enrollments` |

## Best Practices

1. **Set realistic deadlines** - Allow 2-4 weeks for standard training, 1 week for remediation
2. **Send reminders** - Notify at 50% and 75% of deadline elapsed
3. **Keep content fresh** - Rotate training modules quarterly
4. **Match training to threats** - Use phishing failure data to select relevant modules
5. **Track completion trends** - Completion rates should improve over time
6. **Segment by audience** - Executives, IT, finance, and general staff need different content
7. **Combine with phishing** - Always follow training with a phishing simulation to validate
8. **Use gamification** - Games and competitions increase engagement
9. **Report to stakeholders** - Share completion rates with department managers
10. **Automate remediation** - Auto-enroll phishing test failures in relevant training
