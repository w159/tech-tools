# Blumira Users

## Overview

Blumira users are organization members who can access the portal, investigate findings, and manage the environment. This skill covers user listing and lookup, primarily for finding assignment workflows.

## Key Concepts

### User Roles

Users have roles that determine their permissions within the Blumira organization. The API exposes user identity and metadata for assignment and audit purposes.

### User IDs

User IDs (UUIDs) are required when assigning findings to specific analysts. Use `blumira_users_list` to look up IDs.

## API Patterns

### List Users

```
blumira_users_list
  page_size=50
```

Response includes user ID, name, email, and role information.

### Filter Users

```
blumira_users_list
  email.contains=@company.com
```

## Common Workflows

### Find User for Assignment

1. `blumira_users_list` to get all users
2. Identify the appropriate analyst by name or role
3. Use their `user_id` with `blumira_findings_assign`

### User Access Audit

1. `blumira_users_list` with full pagination
2. Review all users with access to the organization
3. Cross-reference with HR/directory for offboarded users
4. Report any discrepancies

## Error Handling

### Empty User List

**Cause:** Token may not have permission to list users
**Solution:** Verify JWT token has appropriate scope for user management.

## Best Practices

- Cache user lists during triage sessions to avoid repeated API calls
- Use email filtering to quickly find specific users
- For MSP environments, use `blumira_msp_users_list` with account context
- Document user-to-role mappings for escalation workflows
