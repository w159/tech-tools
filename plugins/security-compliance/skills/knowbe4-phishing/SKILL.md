# KnowBe4 Phishing Simulation Management

## Overview

KnowBe4 phishing simulations are the core mechanism for testing and improving an organization's resilience to social engineering attacks. Campaigns deliver simulated phishing emails to users and track their interactions - whether they opened the email, clicked the link, submitted data on the landing page, reported it via the Phish Alert Button, or took no action. The phish-prone percentage is the key metric derived from these campaigns.

## Key Concepts

### Campaign Lifecycle

```
CREATED --> SCHEDULED --> IN_PROGRESS --> COMPLETED
                |                              |
                +---- CANCELLED                +--> ARCHIVED
```

- **Created**: Campaign configured but not yet scheduled
- **Scheduled**: Campaign queued for delivery at a specific date/time
- **In Progress**: Emails are being sent and interactions tracked
- **Completed**: Campaign delivery finished, final results available
- **Cancelled**: Campaign aborted before completion
- **Archived**: Completed campaign moved to archive

### Security Test Types

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Phishing** | Standard email with link to landing page | Most common, baseline testing |
| **Vishing** | Voice-based social engineering simulation | Phone-based attack awareness |
| **Smishing** | SMS-based phishing simulation | Mobile threat awareness |
| **USB** | Physical USB drop test | Physical security awareness |
| **QR Code** | QR code-based phishing | Emerging threat vector |

### Recipient Interaction States

Each recipient in a campaign progresses through trackable states:

| State | Description | Indicates |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **Delivered** | Email successfully delivered | Baseline count |
| **Opened** | Recipient opened the email | Curiosity/engagement |
| **Clicked** | Recipient clicked the phishing link | Failed the test |
| **Replied** | Recipient replied to the email | Failed the test (data leakage risk) |
| **Attachment Opened** | Recipient opened an attachment | Failed the test |
| **Macro Enabled** | Recipient enabled macros in attachment | Critical failure |
| **Data Entered** | Recipient submitted data on landing page | Critical failure |
| **Reported** | Recipient reported via Phish Alert Button | Passed the test |
| **No Action** | No interaction recorded | Neutral (may not have seen it) |

### Phish-Prone Percentage Calculation

The phish-prone percentage (PPP) is the primary metric for organizational risk:

```javascript
function calculatePhishPronePercentage(campaign) {
  const totalDelivered = campaign.recipients.filter(r => r.delivered).length;
  const totalFailed = campaign.recipients.filter(r =>
    r.clicked || r.replied || r.attachmentOpened || r.macroEnabled || r.dataEntered
  ).length;

  if (totalDelivered === 0) return 0;
  return ((totalFailed / totalDelivered) * 100).toFixed(1);
}
```

**Industry Benchmarks:**
| PPP Range | Rating | Context |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| 0-5% | Excellent | Well-trained organization |
| 5-15% | Good | Regular training in place |
| 15-30% | Average | Industry baseline for new programs |
| 30-50% | Poor | Needs immediate attention |
| 50%+ | Critical | High-risk organization |

## Common Workflows

### Review Campaign Results

1. **List campaigns** to find the target campaign
2. **Get campaign details** for overview metrics
3. **List security tests** within the campaign
4. **Get security test results** for detailed interaction counts
5. **List recipients** to identify who clicked/failed
6. **Calculate PPP** from the results

### Identify High-Risk Users

1. **List completed campaigns** from a date range
2. **Get recipients** who clicked or entered data across campaigns
3. **Cross-reference** with user profiles for repeat offenders
4. **Generate report** of users who failed multiple tests

### Compare Campaign Performance Over Time

1. **List all campaigns** sorted by date
2. **Get PPP** for each campaign
3. **Track trend** - PPP should decrease over time with training
4. **Identify anomalies** - sudden PPP increase may indicate new attack vector or template difficulty

### Post-Campaign Remediation

1. **Get failed recipients** from completed campaign
2. **Enroll failed users** in remedial training
3. **Schedule follow-up test** targeting the same users
4. **Compare results** to measure improvement

## Error Handling

### Common API Errors

| Code | Message | Resolution |
|------|---------|------------|
| 400 | Invalid campaign parameters | Check date formats and required fields |
| 401 | Invalid API token | Verify KNOWBE4_API_KEY |
| 403 | Insufficient permissions | API token needs Reporting permissions |
| 404 | Campaign not found | Verify campaign_id exists |
| 429 | Rate limit exceeded | Implement backoff (see api-patterns) |

### Data Considerations

| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Zero delivered count | Campaign just started | Wait for delivery to complete |
| High bounce rate | Invalid email addresses | Clean user list before next campaign |
| No reported count | PAB not deployed | Install Phish Alert Button |
| Opened count higher than delivered | Email previews/security scanners | Filter by user agent if available |

## Best Practices

1. **Vary templates** - Use different phishing scenarios to avoid pattern recognition
2. **Spread delivery** - Send over days/weeks, not all at once, to avoid "water cooler effect"
3. **Track trends, not individual tests** - Single campaigns can be noisy; look at 3-6 month trends
4. **Combine with training** - Auto-enroll failed users in relevant training modules
5. **Use realistic scenarios** - Match templates to actual threats your clients face
6. **Baseline first** - Run an initial campaign before training to establish baseline PPP
7. **Report to leadership** - Share PPP trends with management to justify security awareness investment
8. **Test all levels** - Include executives and IT staff, not just general users
9. **Respect local regulations** - Some regions have restrictions on simulated phishing
10. **Set proper tracking duration** - Allow 72 hours minimum for accurate click data
