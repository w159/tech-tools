# Finding Triage

## Prerequisites

- Valid Blumira JWT token configured
- Access to the organization's findings

## Steps

1. Call `blumira_findings_list` with `status.eq=10` (Open) and `order_by=-severity` to get open findings sorted by severity
2. If severity argument provided, add `severity.eq=<value>` filter
3. Group findings by severity level (CRITICAL -> HIGH -> MEDIUM -> LOW)
4. Present a summary table with finding ID, severity, title, and creation date
5. Highlight CRITICAL and HIGH findings that need immediate attention
6. Show total counts per severity level

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| severity | string | No | Filter to specific severity (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW) |
| limit | number | No | Max findings to show (default 25) |

## Examples

### Basic Usage

### Filter to Critical Only
