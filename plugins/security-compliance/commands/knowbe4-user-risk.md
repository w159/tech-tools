# Get User Risk Score and History

Retrieve the risk score, risk history, and contributing factors for a specific KnowBe4 user.

## Prerequisites

- Valid KnowBe4 API key configured
- API token with Reporting permissions
- Correct KNOWBE4_REGION set

## Steps

1. **Resolve user identity**
   - If numeric, use as user ID directly
   - If email, search users by email
   - If name, search by first/last name and confirm match

2. **Get user profile**
   - Use `knowbe4_users_get` for current details and risk score
   - Note department, groups, and phish-prone percentage

3. **Get risk score history**
   - Use `knowbe4_users_risk_score_history` for trend data
   - Default to 6 months if period not specified

4. **Get contributing events**
   - Use `knowbe4_users_risk_score_history` for the risk trend, and `knowbe4_phishing_security_test_recipient` results to see specific phishing-test outcomes for the user
   - Correlate risk score changes with recent phishing-test and training activity

5. **Compare to peers if requested**
   - Get department or group average risk score
   - Calculate user's position relative to peers

6. **Format and display results**
   - Current risk score with level indicator
   - Trend direction (improving, stable, degrading)
   - Contributing factors
   - Recommendations
