# CIPP Tenants

Tenants are the top-level scope in CIPP. Every operational tool - users, mailboxes, standards, security - takes a `tenantFilter` parameter that scopes the call to one tenant or to `allTenants`. Knowing how to enumerate tenants and resolve a friendly name to its tenant ID is the first step in almost every CIPP workflow.

## Tools

### `cipp_list_tenants`

List every tenant CIPP manages. Returns a list of tenant objects with `customerId`, `defaultDomainName`, `displayName`, and onboarding status.

```
cipp_list_tenants()
```

Use this whenever a user refers to a client by name - the response gives you the `defaultDomainName` (or `customerId`) needed for `tenantFilter` on every other tool.

### `cipp_get_tenant_details`

Retrieve detailed information for one tenant: license count, domain list, GDAP relationship status, last refresh time.

```
cipp_get_tenant_details(tenantFilter='contoso.onmicrosoft.com')
```

Use `tenantFilter='allTenants'` to get a portfolio-wide aggregate - useful for fleet reports.

## Identifying a tenant

Most CIPP tools accept any of these in `tenantFilter`:

| Format | Example | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Default domain | `contoso.onmicrosoft.com` | Most readable, recommended |
| Custom domain | `contoso.com` | Works if CIPP has it cached |
| Tenant GUID | `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` | Most stable but opaque |
| `allTenants` | `allTenants` | Portfolio-wide; only some tools support it |

When a user says "Acme", always run `cipp_list_tenants` first and resolve to the canonical `defaultDomainName` before calling other tools. Never guess the tenant identifier.

## Common patterns

**Resolve a friendly name -> tenant filter**

```
tenants = cipp_list_tenants()
acme = next(t for t in tenants if 'acme' in t['displayName'].lower())
tenant_filter = acme['defaultDomainName']
```

**Audit which tenants are stale in CIPP cache**

`cipp_get_tenant_details` returns `lastRefresh`. Tenants not refreshed in >24h often signal a broken GDAP relationship or revoked consent - flag them before running standards or BPA checks against them.

## Failure modes

- **`tenantFilter` not found** - the tenant exists in M365 but CIPP hasn't onboarded it. Trigger a tenant cache refresh in CIPP UI or check GDAP roles.
- **Empty tenant list** - the API client has no tenant scope assigned. Check the role assigned to the API client in CIPP Settings -> API Client Management.
