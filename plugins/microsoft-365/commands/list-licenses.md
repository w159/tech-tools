# List M365 Licenses

Show the current Microsoft 365 license inventory for the tenant, including seat utilization and optimization opportunities.

## Prerequisites

- `Directory.Read.All` - list subscribed SKUs
- `User.Read.All` - per-user license assignments
- `AuditLog.Read.All` - sign-in activity for inactive user detection (optional)

## Steps

1. **Get all subscribed SKUs**
   ```http
   GET /v1.0/subscribedSkus?$select=skuPartNumber,skuId,consumedUnits,prepaidUnits,capabilityStatus
   ```

2. **For `--view users` or `--view unused`**: also fetch all users with licenses
   ```http
   GET /v1.0/users?$select=id,displayName,userPrincipalName,accountEnabled,assignedLicenses,signInActivity&$top=999
   ```

3. **Calculate seat availability** per SKU: `prepaidUnits.enabled - consumedUnits`

4. **Identify optimization opportunities**:
   - Disabled users with licenses still assigned
   - Licensed users with no sign-in for 90+ days
   - SKUs with 0 remaining seats (may need expansion)
