# Offboard M365 User

Execute a structured, safe Microsoft 365 offboarding workflow for a departing employee. Each step is performed in order with confirmation where needed.

## Prerequisites

- `Directory.ReadWrite.All` - revoke sessions, disable account
- `User.ReadWrite.All` - update account properties
- `MailboxSettings.ReadWrite` - configure auto-reply and forwarding
- `Sites.ReadWrite.All` - OneDrive ownership transfer

## Workflow Steps

### Phase 1: Immediate Security (Do First)

1. **Resolve user and confirm**
   ```
   Found: Jane Smith (jsmith@contoso.com)
   Manager: Bob Manager (bmanager@contoso.com)
   Confirm offboarding Jane Smith? [y/n]
   ```

2. **Revoke all active sessions**
   ```http
   POST /v1.0/users/{id}/revokeSignInSessions
   ```
   This immediately terminates all active browser sessions, Teams, mobile apps.

3. **Reset password** (prevents re-authentication even if session cookie reused)

4. **Disable account**
   ```http
   PATCH /v1.0/users/{id}
   { "accountEnabled": false }
   ```

### Phase 2: Mailbox Handling

5. **Set out-of-office reply**
   ```http
   PATCH /v1.0/users/{id}/mailboxSettings
   {
     "automaticRepliesSetting": {
       "status": "alwaysEnabled",
       "internalReplyMessage": "Jane Smith has left the company. Please contact their manager Bob Manager at bmanager@contoso.com.",
       "externalReplyMessage": "Jane Smith is no longer with Contoso. For assistance, please contact support@contoso.com."
     }
   }
   ```

6. **Handle mailbox** (per `--mailbox-action`):
   - `shared`: Convert to shared mailbox, grant manager full access
   - `forward`: Configure mail forwarding to manager/transfer-to
   - `archive`: Note for admin to export via Compliance Center

### Phase 3: Data and Access

7. **Check for Teams ownership** - list teams where user is sole owner
   ```http
   GET /v1.0/users/{id}/joinedTeams
   ```
   For each: check members, warn if sole owner.

8. **Remove from Teams** (after transferring ownership where needed)
   ```http
   DELETE /v1.0/teams/{teamId}/members/{memberId}
   ```

9. **OneDrive ownership transfer**
   - Grant manager access to OneDrive: `POST /v1.0/drives/{driveId}/root/invite`
   - Note: Full transfer requires SharePoint admin actions

10. **Remove licenses** (frees seats, retains data for 30 days)
    ```http
    POST /v1.0/users/{id}/assignLicense
    { "addLicenses": [], "removeLicenses": ["<all-sku-guids>"] }
    ```

  4. Convert mailbox to shared
  5. Grant bmanager@contoso.com mailbox access
  6. Remove from 5 Teams
