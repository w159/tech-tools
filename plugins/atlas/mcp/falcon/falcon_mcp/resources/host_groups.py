=== BASIC SYNTAX ===
property_name:[operator]'value'

=== AVAILABLE OPERATORS ===
• No operator = equals (default)
• ! = not equal to
• > = greater than (timestamp fields)
• >= = greater than or equal (timestamp fields)
• < = less than (timestamp fields)
• <= = less than or equal (timestamp fields)
• ~ = text match (case insensitive)

=== DATA TYPES & SYNTAX ===
• Strings: 'value'
• Dates: 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ' (UTC format) or relative like 'now-30d'
• Booleans: true or false (no quotes)

=== COMBINING CONDITIONS ===
• + = AND condition
• , = OR condition
• ( ) = Group expressions

=== EXAMPLE QUERIES ===

**By name:**
• name:'Production Servers'

**By type:**
• group_type:'static'
• group_type:'staticByID'
• group_type:'dynamic'

**By creator:**
• created_by:'user@example.com'

**Recently created:**
• created_timestamp:>'now-30d'
• created_timestamp:>'2024-01-01T00:00:00Z'

**Recently modified:**
• modified_timestamp:>'now-7d'

**Combined Conditions:**
• group_type:'static'+created_by:'user@example.com'
• (group_type:'static',group_type:'staticByID')+modified_timestamp:>'now-30d'

=== 💡 SYNTAX RULES ===
• Use single quotes around string values: 'value'
• Date format must be UTC: 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ'
• Relative dates use lowercase quoted syntax: 'now-7d', 'now-30d'
• Combine conditions with + (AND) or , (OR)

=== NOTE ON MEMBER SEARCH ===
The falcon_search_host_group_members tool filters on HOST (device) attributes,
not host group attributes. Consult falcon://hosts/search/fql-guide for the
filter syntax of that tool.
