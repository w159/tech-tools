SEARCH_CORRELATION_RULES_FQL_DOCUMENTATION = r"""Falcon Query Language (FQL) - Search Correlation Rules Guide

=== BASIC SYNTAX ===
field_name:[operator]'value'

=== OPERATORS ===
• = (default): field_name:'value'
• ~: field_name:~'partial' (contains match, case insensitive)
• >, >=, <, <=: field_name:>50 (comparison for numbers/timestamps)
• !: field_name:!'value' (not equal)

=== DATA TYPES ===
• String: 'value'
• Integer: 50 (no quotes)
• Timestamp: 'YYYY-MM-DD' or 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ'

=== COMBINING ===
• + = AND: status:'active'+severity:>50
• , = OR: mitre_attack.tactic_id:'TA0001',mitre_attack.tactic_id:'TA0002'

=== SORT OPTIONS ===
Sort fields: created_on, last_updated_on, name, severity, status
Sort formats: 'field.asc', 'field.desc', 'field|asc', 'field|desc'
Example: 'last_updated_on.desc'

=== SEVERITY SCORES ===
• 10 = Informational
• 30 = Low
• 50 = Medium
• 70 = High
• 90 = Critical

Use range operators for severity:
• High and above: severity:>=70
• Medium and above: severity:>=50
• Critical only: severity:>=90

=== STATUS vs STATE ===
These are distinct fields:
• status: execution state — 'active' or 'inactive'
• state: version lifecycle — 'published', 'unpublished', or 'draft'

A rule can be active but unpublished, or published but inactive.

=== MITRE ATT&CK MAPPING ===
The mitre_attack field uses ATT&CK tactic IDs (TA####) and technique IDs (T####).
Filter on nested fields:
• ✅ Correct: mitre_attack.tactic_id:'TA0001'
• ❌ Wrong: mitre_attack.tactic_id:'Execution'

Common tactic IDs:
• TA0001: Initial Access
• TA0002: Execution
• TA0003: Persistence
• TA0004: Privilege Escalation
• TA0005: Defense Evasion
• TA0006: Credential Access
• TA0007: Discovery
• TA0008: Lateral Movement
• TA0009: Collection
• TA0010: Exfiltration
• TA0011: Command and Control
