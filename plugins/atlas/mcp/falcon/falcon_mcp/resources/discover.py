=== AUTOMATIC FILTERING ===
This tool automatically filters for managed assets only by adding entity_type:'managed' to all queries.
You do not need to (and cannot) specify entity_type in your filter - it is always set to 'managed'.

=== WHAT THIS TOOL ADDS OVER falcon_search_hosts ===
Managed assets expose asset and configuration posture that the Hosts API does not carry:
drive encryption (encryption_status, unencrypted_drives), OS security settings
(os_security.* - Secure Boot, Credential Guard, IOMMU, VBS), and disk/memory/CPU capacity
and usage. Use falcon_search_hosts for sensor state (containment, sensor version, policies).

=== falcon_search_managed_assets FQL filter options ===

""" + generate_md_table(SEARCH_MANAGED_ASSETS_FQL_FILTERS) + """

=== IMPORTANT NOTES ===
• entity_type:'managed' is automatically applied - do not include in your filter
• aid is the same identifier as the device ID returned by falcon_search_hosts / falcon_get_host_details
• If you already have an aid, prefer it - it is unique per sensor and pins exactly one host (hostname can be shared). You do not need to fetch an aid first; when starting from a general question, filter by whatever fields fit it
• os_security.* fields are booleans - use true/false (no quotes), not 'Enabled'/'Disabled'
• Numeric fields (disk/memory/CPU) work with the greater-than operator (e.g. :>0); the '<' operator on disk-space fields can return a server error
• Encryption and os_security fields are populated only on assets that report that data (mainly Windows); other assets may omit these fields
• Use single quotes around string values: 'value'
• Use square brackets for exact matches and multiple values: ['value1','value2']
• Date format must be UTC: 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ'

=== COMMON FILTER EXAMPLES ===
• Look up a known host by its device ID (aid): aid:'29fa15c9cebe4d3f90f4cbe0498e8c7a'
• Find unencrypted assets: encryption_status:'Unencrypted'
• Find assets with unencrypted drives: unencrypted_drives_count:>0
• Find assets without Secure Boot: os_security.secure_boot_enabled_status:false
• Find assets with Credential Guard enabled: os_security.credential_guard_status:true
• Find Windows assets: platform_name:'Windows'
• Find critical assets: criticality:'Critical'
• Find internet-exposed assets: internet_exposure:'Yes'
• Find recently seen assets: last_seen_timestamp:>'now-24h'

=== COMPLEX QUERY EXAMPLES ===
• Unencrypted Windows workstations: platform_name:'Windows'+product_type_desc:'Workstation'+encryption_status:'Unencrypted'
• Critical internet-exposed servers: criticality:'Critical'+product_type_desc:'Server'+internet_exposure:'Yes'
• Windows assets missing Credential Guard: platform_name:'Windows'+os_security.credential_guard_status:false
