"""Atlas self-improvement nudge — enhanced to report what was captured.

Fires on Stop and SubagentStop after memory_capture.py and auto_skill.py have
already run. Instead of just saying "please capture a lesson," it reports
what was actually captured by the hooks above, and only nudges if nothing
was captured but the session was orchestrating.

Rate-limited and non-blocking: returns additionalContext only, never exit 2.
Self-throttles via a timestamp marker so it fires at most once per window.
Any error exits 0 silently.
