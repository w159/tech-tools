"""Stop hook -- the atlas "Definition of done" gate (opt-in).

The atlas-engine skill's hardest rule is that a change is not *done* until observed
behavior is captured AND an independent agent has verified it. Prose alone does not
enforce this (the orchestrator rationalizes "I'll mark it unverified and move on").
This hook is the machine backstop.

It is **scoped**: it only engages when the working directory (or a detected project
root above it) holds a `docs/` directory -- i.e. the docs/ single source of truth is
present. In any other session it is a silent no-op, so it is safe to leave installed.

Three conditions must ALL hold before the gate passes (else block ONCE):
  (a) At least one file exists under `docs/evidence/`.
  (b) `docs/.run/findings.json` exists and contains at least one entry with
      status "verified".
  (c) `docs/CHANGELOG.md` exists and is non-empty (docs-current backstop).

If any of the three are missing the hook blocks and names exactly which condition
failed and that docs/ must be current (CHANGELOG, ROADMAP, affected subfolders)
before calling the work done.

Fail-open by construction: any error, missing dir, or unparseable input lets the
stop proceed. Disable entirely with ATLAS_GATE=off. Opt-out (on by default when
a docs/ tree is present and wired in hooks.json on Stop; set ATLAS_GATE=off to
disable).

Stdlib only.
