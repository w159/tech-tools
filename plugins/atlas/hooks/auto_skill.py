"""Atlas auto-skill hook — automatically creates skills from worthy sessions.

Fires on Stop. Uses skill_factory.auto_create_from_session() to:
  1. Find the most recent orchestrating session
  2. Check if it's skill-worthy (>= 5 tool calls, learnable signals)
  3. Extract lessons (improvements, corrections, error patterns)
  4. Create a SKILL.md under ~/.claude/skills/ with `created_by: "atlas-auto"` provenance

The created skill shows up with a "learned" label — it was auto-learned from
session experience. The atlas curator will manage its lifecycle (stale/archive).

This mirrors Hermes Agent's skill_manage(action='create') but is hook-driven:
the agent doesn't need to decide to save — it happens automatically.

Fail-open: any error exits 0 silently. Disable with ATLAS_AUTO_SKILL=off.
Rate-limited: at most once per 10 minutes via a marker file.
