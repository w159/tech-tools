# Development

## Run it

Run the server and Vite side by side:

```bash
bun install
bun run server   # API + WebSocket on :7317
bun run dev      # Vite on :5173, proxies /api and /ws
```

`bun run server` and `bun run dev` never update themselves; only `bun run start` and the plugin run the update supervisor.

## Checks

```bash
bun run typecheck
bun run build
bun run test:unit               # no herdr needed; CI's Fast checks run it
bun test                        # needs herdr installed; creates and removes its own workspaces
bun run test:ui                 # browser regression against isolated test servers
bun scripts/chat-browser-qa.ts  # chat lens end to end
bun scripts/output-browser-qa.ts # terminal output flow control end to end
bun scripts/math-browser-qa.ts  # chat math: KaTeX loads with the first expression
bun run test:ssh                # remote-PC integration over SSH
bun scripts/fresh-install-docker.ts [owner/repo] [ref]  # a new user's install in a bare Ubuntu (Docker)
```

`fresh-install-docker.ts` is the check for "does a new user get a working install": a disposable
Ubuntu 24.04 with only curl, git and the distro's Node 18, a normal user, herdr and Bun from their
installers, a headless herdr, then `herdr plugin install` of a pushed ref (default: the current
branch), the start action, `/api/health`, the PTY smoke test on the box's Node, and the startup hook
after a herdr restart. It prints the time each step took. `KEEP=1` leaves the container for a look.

Tests run against a herdr session of their own, `herdr-web-ui-test`. The first run starts a headless `herdr --session herdr-web-ui-test server` and later runs reuse it, so test workspaces never show in the herdr you work in (`scripts/test-herdr.ts`). Stop it with `herdr --session herdr-web-ui-test server stop`. `HERDR_TEST_SESSION` picks another name, and `HERDR_TEST_LIVE=1` runs against `HERDR_SOCKET` or your default session instead.

Browser checks look for Chrome at `/opt/google/chrome/chrome`; set `CHROME_PATH` otherwise. After a herdr upgrade, refresh the generated wire types with `bun run generate:types --refresh` (and `--check` to verify).

For isolated phone viewer and keyboard layout regressions (no herdr session; the demo runner builds the real client locally):

```bash
bun scripts/file-viewer-mobile-regression.ts  # 8 viewport cases × tall/wide images
bun scripts/keyboard-viewport-regression.ts   # keyboard, rotation and measured standalone status inset
bun scripts/keyboard-viewport-demo-regression.ts # original real-app viewport suite on disposable demo fixtures
bun scripts/droplet-demo-regression.ts        # real-app alerts below the header, keyboard and landscape
bun scripts/chat-greeting-demo-regression.ts  # an empty chat's greeting: centred on a desktop, docked on a phone
bun scripts/composer-fit-demo-regression.ts   # the input card's model label: whole or stepped out beside Queue, the context number and an upload; the box's text at Chat font size
bun scripts/held-rows-demo-regression.ts      # held messages: the fold under an approval card, its button, a row's error
bun scripts/prompt-dock-demo-regression.ts    # the prompt card docked over the input card: its place, its height on a short phone, the grip, a typed pick
bun scripts/font-swap-demo-regression.ts      # the app's faces arriving late on a slow link: a reader at the end of a chat stays there, a tab strip the user scrolled stays put
```

`FILE_VIEWER_CASE=landscape-notch` selects a viewer case; `FILE_VIEWER_CSS=/path/to/before.css` compares another stylesheet. These checks use Chromium mobile emulation and synthetic safe-area/keyboard geometry; they cannot verify actual iOS Safari keyboard dismissal or notch insets. The existing `bun scripts/file-viewer-regression.ts` separately checks history with an owned herdr pane. The original `scripts/mobile-viewport-regression.ts` exports `checkMobileViewport` for the real-app `bun run test:ui` suite; it also checks the command palette and xterm focus transitions. The demo runners build the real client into a temporary directory, inject the committed fictional-session transport and serve it only on loopback; they do not use a live herdr session or download website media. They exercise real-app viewport and alert geometry, but not live herdr connectivity.

## README media

`bun run build && bun scripts/readme-media/capture.ts` regenerates the stills and demos in `docs/screenshots/` from a staged, fictional session in its own herdr session (`herdr-web-ui-demo`). Pass `shots` or `video` to redo only one of them. It needs ffmpeg.

- `stage.ts` builds the session: five workspaces under `/tmp/herdr-demo`, curated chats served in place of transcripts, and the hostname rewritten.
- `record.ts` records a walkthrough at 2x (Chrome's screencast, with `--force-device-scale-factor=2`), logging pointer moves, clicks, taps and camera cues as it drives the page.
- `compose.ts` draws every output frame on a canvas: a backdrop, a browser window or a phone, the frame under an eased camera, and a vector cursor with click ripples or touch rings. It writes `demo-*.mp4` (1920×1200 and 1080×1920, 30 fps) and a GIF of each. Stills get the same window or phone on a transparent background.

The MP4s are not committed: GitHub plays a README video only from an upload (`github.com/user-attachments/…`), so drop them into an issue or PR comment and use the link it gives.
The website's page is built from the README's own artifacts: it downloads the README's top video (listed in `scripts/build-site.ts`, `videos`, so a new top video needs its link changed there as well), shows the feature grid's clips linking to their uploads (the same list of links is in `site/index.html`), and uses `docs/screenshots/install.png`.
The README's feature grid shows a looping ~7-second cut of each feature video (`docs/media/readme/*.webp`, 800×450, 15 fps), each linking to its upload. Cut one with
`ffmpeg -ss <start> -t <seconds> -i clip.mp4 -vf "fps=15,scale=800:450:force_original_aspect_ratio=increase:flags=lanczos,crop=800:450" -c:v libwebp_anim -loop 0 -quality 72 -compression_level 6 -an out.webp`;
the scale and crop fill 800×450 from any source aspect. Start on a sharp frame, not mid camera move. The top video stays a GitHub upload so it plays at full quality.

The user guide's gallery and the retained banner assets are rendered from the film's stills (below): `bun scripts/readme-media/banner.ts [banner] [og] [look]`
draws `banner.html` in headless Chrome into `docs/media/banner.png` (1920×800), `site/assets/og.png` (1280×640) and
`docs/media/look-{chat,prompt,terminal}.png` (1760×1150), each quantized to 256 colours. `docs/media/chat-loop.gif`
comes from `scripts/film/render.ts loop`.

## The film

The film (`site/media/herdr-web-ui-film.mp4`, 56 s) and chat loop (`site/media/chat-loop.mp4`, with the README's
`docs/media/chat-loop.gif`) are the real client on the demo's fixtures, recorded and composited by `scripts/film/`.
Raw footage and renders go to `_film/` (gitignored); only the outputs under `site/media/`, `site/assets/` and
`docs/media/` are committed. Needs ffmpeg and Chrome at `/usr/bin/google-chrome` (`CHROME_PATH` otherwise).

```bash
bun run build:site                              # the demo the takes are recorded from
bun scripts/film/capture.ts [stills] [rec] [stepped] [R10 R11 … | still names]   # _film/footage/
bun scripts/film/site-assets.ts                 # site/assets/*.webp|jpg|png from the stills
bun scripts/readme-media/banner.ts              # banner, og.png, look-*.png from the stills
bun scripts/film/render.ts film                 # site/media/herdr-web-ui-film.{mp4,jpg}
bun scripts/film/render.ts loop                 # site/media/chat-loop.{mp4,jpg}, docs/media/chat-loop.gif
bun scripts/film/render.ts check                # acceptance frame grabs, sizes, loop seam
```

- `capture.ts` serves `_site/` under `/herdr-web-ui/` and records `demo/app/` (no demo banner) at 2x with `hand.ts`
  (CDP screencast frames with paint times, plus a cue log of every pointer move, click and tap). Film-only staging lives
  here as init scripts, never in `site/demo/`: fixture `mods` (`todo`, `real`, `stream`, `story`, `worked`) change what
  the fixtures say, and `filmHold` holds the demo's own 4.5 s / 2.4 s timers so a turn stays running on camera.
  `_film/footage/INDEX.md` lists every take, its mods and its marks.
- `timeline.ts` is the film shot by shot as data (source ranges from each take's `marks.json`, camera, type);
  `camera.ts` the easing and matrices; `stage.ts` the compositor page that draws one frame; `footage.ts` reads the takes.
- `render.ts` renders frames in parallel Chromes and encodes once. `render.ts report` prints the shot table with the
  maximum magnification (never above 1 source px per output px); `render.ts stills 8 13.6 …` grabs single frames.
- After a re-capture, re-check what was placed by hand on the frames (the header of `render.ts` lists it), then
  re-render. `build-site.ts` fails if a file in `site/media/` is over 4 MB (the film: 24 MB) or one in `site/assets/`
  is over 750 KB.

## Website

<https://devswha.github.io/herdr-web-ui/> is `site/index.html`, a static page with desktop and phone
demos, a screenshot gallery, supported agents, phone setup and a comparison table. `bun run build:site`
assembles it into `_site/` with icons, the social preview and scaled screenshots from `docs/screenshots/`.
The two demo videos come from local `docs/screenshots/*.mp4` when present, otherwise the README's uploads;
ffmpeg creates their poster frames. Without ffmpeg, the page omits unavailable posters.

For search engines the build also writes `sitemap.xml` (the page only: the demo is `noindex`) and copies
the page's FAQ rows (`<div class="qa">`) into its head as FAQPage structured data, so edit a question in
the page and the data follows. The SoftwareApplication data is written in the page's head by hand.

The build also copies the retained `site/assets/` and `site/media/` files, including the film linked
from the README and its chat loop. These remain available at their existing URLs even though the
homepage uses the desktop and phone demos.
`.github/workflows/pages.yml` installs ffmpeg, runs the same build and deploys it to GitHub Pages on
every push to `main`.

### The browser demo

<https://devswha.github.io/herdr-web-ui/demo/> is the real client on a fictional session, no server.
`build-site.ts` builds the client a second time with `vite build --base ./` into `_site/demo/app/`,
bundles `site/demo/transport.ts` in front of it and frames it with `site/demo/index.html`. The
transport answers the app's `fetch("/api/…")`, the machines event stream and the `/ws` terminal
socket from `site/demo/fixtures/`: the chats and the Codex approval are the README's
(`site/demo/fixtures.ts`, shared with `scripts/readme-media/stage.ts`), and `machines.json`,
`agents.json`, `commands.json` and the shell pane's `terminal.json` are captured from that staged
session by `bun scripts/demo-fixtures.ts` (needs herdr; it uses the `herdr-web-ui-demo` session and
scrubs the hostname and login). Recapture them after a herdr upgrade changes the snapshot shapes, or
after changing the staged session. Files, images, push and remote PCs are not part of the demo.

## Releasing

1. Open a release PR that bumps `version` in `package.json` and `herdr-plugin.toml`,
   and moves the `Unreleased` notes in [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) under the new version.
2. Merge it after CI passes.
3. Run **Actions → Release → Run workflow**, select `main`, and enter `X.Y.Z` without `v`.
   The CLI equivalent is `gh workflow run release.yml --ref main -f version=X.Y.Z`.

The workflow validates metadata, then runs the same unit, integration and browser checks
as PRs against the exact `main` commit selected when the run starts. Only after all checks
pass does it create the tag and GitHub release. A failed validation creates neither.
Do not push release tags by hand: installed updaters read Git tags directly, so a tag is
visible to them even without a GitHub release. Existing tags cannot be reused; fix a
published version with a new patch release. If publishing fails after a tag was created,
verify that tag's commit and repair its GitHub release rather than moving the tag.

Remote-PC runtime bundles are released separately: raise `REMOTE_BUNDLE_VERSION` in `shared/machines.ts` and push a `remote-vN` tag. See [remote PCs](remote-pcs.md).

## Pull requests and CI

Contributors: [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) is the short version of this section.

Use short-lived `feat/*`, `fix/*` or `chore/*` branches from `main`. Keep each PR focused
on one change, squash merge it after required checks pass, and delete its remote branch
after merging. Remove local branches/worktrees only when their work is finished.
There is no permanent `develop` branch. Release metadata changes also go through a PR.

The [CI workflow](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs on every PR and `main` push:

- **Fast checks**: frozen dependency install, generated type freshness, typecheck, build,
  and `bun run test:unit`. This suite does not start herdr.
- **Integration and browser**: checksum-pinned herdr 0.9.3, Node 22, isolated state/session,
  `bun run test:integration`, and `scripts/ui-regression.ts` with the lockfile's Chromium.
  The two run at the same time (`scripts/ci-lanes.ts`). The integration files can run a few
  at a time, each worker on a herdr session of its own (`scripts/ci-tests.ts`); CI runs them
  one by one (`HERDR_TEST_SHARDS: 1`) until the timing-bound contract tests hold under load.
  Missing herdr fails the integration suite. The owned session is stopped even on failure.
  Integration tests have a 15-second default timeout so their bounded process-startup
  probes can finish; individual tests can still specify a longer timeout.

`scripts/ci-tests.ts` discovers all `.test.ts` files under src/shared/server/scripts.
Files named `*.contract.test.ts`, tests under `server/herdr/` and `server/pty/`, and
`server/updater.test.ts` (which includes real bridge restart/rollback cases) belong
to integration; everything else belongs to unit. Name new live-server tests
`*.contract.test.ts`. Plain `bun test` still runs both suites for local development.

Remote/server/shared/dependency changes also run the existing four-platform bundle and
SSH workflow on PRs; its publishing job only runs for `remote-v*` tags. Website publishing
continues after `main` pushes.

Repository protection should require PRs and both CI checks on `main`, including for
administrators, with branches up to date before merging. Force pushes and branch deletion
are disabled. Human approvals are optional for this maintainer-led project; external
contributions still need maintainer review. CodeRabbit is advisory, not a required check.
Release tags must not be moved or deleted. These GitHub settings are separate from files
in the checkout.

The [CodeRabbit configuration](../.coderabbit.yaml) reviews non-draft PRs, reads the committed
[review guidelines](../.github/REVIEW.md) and the AGENTS.md files,
and focuses on protocol, permissions and terminal lifecycle regressions. Generated output
and media are excluded. Enable the [CodeRabbit GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/coderabbitai)
for this repository to activate it; the YAML alone does not install the app. Reassess
useful findings versus false positives after two weeks. Keep final merge decisions with
the maintainer.

See [Terminal input](terminal-input.md) for input readiness, draft ownership and the mobile
input regression matrix.
