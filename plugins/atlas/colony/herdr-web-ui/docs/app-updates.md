# App update implementation and verification

The previous app had network-first PWA navigation and immutable frontend assets, but no server update discovery or installation. The new managed entrypoint adds both. See [update usage](guide.md#updates).

## Reference and choices

Inspected `devswha/chatmux` at commit `3b1f3b49216157399e3fb9666a49c942908c3e32` in `/home/devswha/workspace/chatmux`. Its [version check hook](https://github.com/devswha/chatmux/blob/3b1f3b49216157399e3fb9666a49c942908c3e32/src/hooks/useVersionCheck.ts) periodically checks for updates; its [self-update service](https://github.com/devswha/chatmux/blob/3b1f3b49216157399e3fb9666a49c942908c3e32/server/self-update.ts) handles source/release installation. Chatmux is AGPL-3.0; herdr-web-ui is MIT. This implementation adopts behavior and contains no copied chatmux code.

| Priority | Adopted behavior | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Automatic discovery, explicit install | Supervisor checks after 10 seconds/every 5 minutes for the highest plain `vX.Y.Z` tag (bundle `remote-v*` tags and pre-releases are ignored; annotated tags are peeled to their commit); Settings provides check/install controls |
| 2 | Protect locally modified or diverged source | Clean `main` checkout required (herdr's shallow, detached plugin checkout is accepted when running as that plugin); exact target SHA and ancestry verified; source worktree never rewritten |
| 3 | Verify deployment and recover | Build isolated checkout, restart bridge, match a fresh boot ID through health, restore prior build on failure |
| 4 | Optional unattended installation | `HERDR_WEB_AUTO_UPDATE=1`; persist failed SHA to prevent repeating a bad automatic deployment |

Chatmux's systemd-specific launcher and release archive pipeline were not adopted: this repository distributes Git source through Bun and herdr plugins, including macOS. The supervisor uses [Bun's supported IPC](https://bun.sh/docs/runtime/child-process#inter-process-communication-ipc). No runtime dependencies were added.

## Boundaries

- `server/managed.ts` is the launcher: the process `bun run start` and the plugin start and record. It runs `server/supervisor.ts` from the active release (`current.json`, only while it matches the source checkout's HEAD), else its own copy. `server/supervisor.ts` owns the bridge process and health-checked rollback. `server/updater.ts` owns bounded Git/build commands, source guards, release selection and persistence. Only the supervisor runs discovery timers.
- Supervisor handover: after an install passes the bridge health check and is committed, the supervisor exits with 75 before reporting `idle`; the launcher then starts the new release's supervisor, which restarts the bridge from the same release (a second brief reconnect). A new supervisor that exits before it reports ready is replaced by the previous one (then the checkout's own), which runs the new release and reports the failure in the update status until the next update. Handover only happens under the launcher.
- `server/update-api.ts` relays requests/status over IPC. `/api/updates*` uses the existing token gate; POSTs require a custom header and reject cross-site browser requests. The browser cannot choose an executable, directory, remote or revision.
- `shared/update.ts` defines the status contract. `src/lib/updates.ts` polls it after authentication. `UpdateControls.tsx` displays Settings controls and the header notice, whose **Update** button installs the release from there; both show the install's `step` (download, dependencies, typecheck, build, restart) as a step count and a bar. The compiled frontend revision identifies when a reload is needed; reloading remains explicit to preserve drafts.
- `bun run start` and plugin `start` use the supervisor; `bun run server` remains unmanaged. Restart an older running server once to adopt this entrypoint. Updates replace the supervisor through the handover above; only the launcher (`server/managed.ts`, kept small and dependency-light) stays loaded from the source checkout, so a launcher change needs a restart from an updated checkout (plugin reinstall or `git pull`).
- Update data is separate from push keys/subscriptions. State and socket paths are resolved before launching a candidate, so changing the candidate working directory cannot redirect either. The source checkout and the two most recent successful isolated builds remain available.
- Discovery/build failures keep the serving bridge alive. A failed candidate boot restores the previous build. If both candidate and previous build cannot start (for example herdr is unavailable), the failure remains in supervisor logs and needs normal service recovery.

## Verification

- `bun test`: full suite passed. The update suite also passed after adding the failed-revision retry regression (8 tests).
- `bun test server/updater.test.ts`: real temporary Git remotes, pinned builds, unchanged source, local-change/branch/divergence guards, build failure cleanup, IPC installation with the real bridge and live herdr, failed-boot rollback, saved-release restart, automatic install, duplicate requests, bounded subprocess cancellation, and persistent failed-revision retry suppression.
- `server/api.contract.test.ts`: update status cache policy, token protection, cross-site/form rejection and unmanaged installation rejection.
- `bun run typecheck` and `bun run build` passed.
- `bun scripts/update-browser-qa.ts`: actual source copy, private Git remote, candidate dependency installation/typecheck/build, desktop check/install, new frontend reload, retained unsent draft and owned herdr pane, deliberately failed server boot/rollback, mobile update-section bounds, and no browser JavaScript errors. The temporary server, browser and workspace are cleaned up.
- Screenshots and the supervisor log are generated under gitignored `evidence/updates/`. They are QA artifacts, not README/demo screenshots.
