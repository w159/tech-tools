/**
 * The name a person calls a model by, for the composer's pill, or the id exactly as received.
 *
 * A name is never guessed. Only an id that matches one of the patterns below WHOLE gets one,
 * and each pattern is the vendor's own regular id-to-name rule:
 * - Anthropic: `claude-<family>-<major>[-<minor>]` is "Claude <Family> <major>[.<minor>]"
 *   (claude-opus-5-5 is Claude Opus 5.5, claude-sonnet-5 is Claude Sonnet 5, claude-haiku-4-5 is
 *   Claude Haiku 4.5). The pill draws it as Claude Code's own status line does, without the
 *   vendor word ("Opus 5.5"): the agent mark beside it and the agent's read name say whose it is.
 *   The same id behind the vendor's own provider prefix (`anthropic/claude-opus-5-5`, as pi and
 *   omo record it) is the same model.
 * - OpenAI: `gpt-<version>` is "GPT-<version>" (gpt-5.6 is GPT-5.6), and `gpt-<version>-sol` is
 *   "GPT-<version>-Sol", written as Codex's own status line writes it (the "GPT-6-Sol" captured
 *   in server/prompt.test.ts). No other tier word has a source here, so none is named.
 * - Z.ai: `glm-<version>` is "GLM-<version>" (glm-5.3 is GLM-5.3).
 *
 * The patterns follow the vendor's id SYNTAX, not a list of released versions. That was chosen
 * so a new model needs no change here, and its cost is accepted: an id of the right shape for a
 * version that does not exist (claude-opus-9-9, gpt-10) is named too.
 *
 * In return the syntax is read strictly: an id that is not in the vendor's canonical form is not
 * named. A version part is one or two digits with no leading zero (claude-sonnet-5-05, gpt-05.6
 * and glm-5.03 stay ids), a major is never 0, and a minor of 0 is canonical only where the
 * vendor writes one: Anthropic does (claude-opus-4-0), OpenAI and Z.ai write the bare major
 * (gpt-5, not gpt-5.0). The id is lowercase, with nothing before, between or after its parts.
 *
 * Everything else is drawn as the identifier it is: a dated snapshot (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001),
 * a tier or product word this file cannot name for certain (gpt-5.6-sol-max, gpt-4.1-mini), an
 * older id order (claude-3-5-sonnet), another provider's route to a model (bedrock/…), and every
 * vendor not listed. So no suffix is ever dropped: an id either reads whole as a name or is shown
 * whole. The raw id stays in the label's title either way.
