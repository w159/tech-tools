 * bracketed-paste mode (term.modes.bracketedPasteMode):
 * - mode on (agent TUIs): the text goes out as ONE bracketed paste - newlines stay
 *   literal inside the message - and a bare CR submits it, exactly like paste+Enter.
 * - mode off (plain shell): classic paste semantics - every newline submits its own
 *   line, and the trailing CR runs the last one.
 * Pure logic, DOM-free, so the policy is unit-testable (see compose.test.ts).
