<p align="center"><sub>Claude Code asks in herdr's terminal; the browser and the phone show the same question, and one tap on the phone answers it · recorded live, no cuts</sub></p>

**Claude Code and Codex, from your phone.**

A browser and phone client for [herdr](https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr). Read and reply to the same agent sessions running on your computer — on desktop or phone, as chat, with the terminal when you need it.

- **Chat and terminal, one pane** — native Claude Code, Codex, omp, omo, gjc and pi transcripts, with the live terminal a click away. [Supported agents →](docs/guide.md#supported-agents)
- **Approve with a tap** — approvals, questions and plan menus become cards, checked to be current before your answer is sent.
- **Know when you're needed** — live status for every pane, an alert that drops in while the app is open, and push alerts when an agent needs input or finishes, even with the app closed.
- **Install it on your phone** — a PWA with Esc, Tab, Ctrl, Alt and arrows above the keyboard, and a QR code to your Tailscale address. [Phone setup →](docs/guide.md#on-your-phone)
- **Speak instead of typing** — dictate into the chat or the terminal line, Korean and English mixed. Review the words before sending them to the agent; transcription uses your own OpenAI key or the browser's speech recognition.
- **Keep your workflow** — herdr owns the agents; this app connects to them. Update from Settings without stopping them. New tabs and worktrees come from a row's ⋯ menu. [All features →](docs/guide.md#features)

## install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://devswha.github.io/herdr-web-ui/install.sh | sh
```

Linux (x64, arm64) or macOS. Installs missing herdr 0.9.0+, Bun 1.4+ and Node 18+ prerequisites for your user, then installs the app as a herdr plugin. If an existing herdr installation is older than 0.9.0, update and restart herdr yourself before rerunning the installer. With the default listen address and Tailscale running, successful HTTPS setup provides a tailnet address and QR code.

Windows x64, in PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://devswha.github.io/herdr-web-ui/install.ps1 | iex
```

Requires [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win). Installs missing herdr and Bun for your user, then installs the same plugin. No Node or WSL is needed. Open **Phone setup** in herdr for phone access. Windows terminals use the [screen mirror](docs/remote-pcs.md#windows-pcs), with typing and a fixed grid, until herdr supports terminal attach there.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/install.png" width="720" alt="Installer output: Bun, Node and the herdr plugin install, then tailscale serve publishes the app and a QR code for the phone appears.">
</p>

Already have the prerequisites? Install just the plugin:

```bash
herdr plugin install devswha/herdr-web-ui
```

With herdr running, open **[localhost:7317](http://localhost:7317)**. Pick a pane or start an agent with **New workspace**. To use your phone, scan the installer's QR code and add the app to your home screen. [Quick start →](docs/guide.md#quick-start)

The server listens on `127.0.0.1` by default. For access from another device, see [phone setup](docs/guide.md#on-your-phone) and [access and safety](docs/guide.md#access-and-safety).

## faq

**Can I use Claude Code or Codex from my phone?**

Yes. Run the agent in a [herdr](https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr) pane on your computer, and this app shows the same pane in your phone's browser: the agent's own transcript as a chat, its approvals and questions as cards you tap, and the live terminal a tap away. It installs to the home screen as a PWA and sends a push alert when an agent needs you. [Phone setup →](docs/guide.md#on-your-phone)

**Which agents does the chat view support?**

Claude Code, Codex, omp, omo, gjc and pi are read from their own session files. Any other program in a herdr pane gets the live terminal and its status. [Supported agents →](docs/guide.md#supported-agents)

**Does it replace herdr's own TUI?**

No. Both attach to the same terminals at the same time, so the pane stays live at your desk, in the browser and on the phone. Nothing is stopped or handed over. [TUI and browser →](docs/guide.md#faq)

**Do I need Tailscale?**

No. Tailscale, an SSH tunnel, a VPN or your own HTTPS proxy can provide a route to the PC. Installation and push alerts need a secure context such as HTTPS or localhost; basic browsing also works over plain HTTP on a LAN. [The options →](docs/guide.md#faq)

**Does my code or conversation leave my machine?**

Session files stay on the PC running each agent, and their contents are served to browsers you connect. The app has no hosted relay or account service of its own. Optional voice input sends audio (and text when polishing) to the configured provider; enabled usage meters contact provider APIs. Updates, remote-PC setup and push alerts can also use external services. The agents’ own model connections depend on their configuration. [Data flow and access →](docs/guide.md#faq)

**Does it work on Windows?**

Yes, on Windows x64 without WSL. Until herdr can attach a terminal there, the terminal is a [screen mirror](docs/remote-pcs.md#windows-pcs) with typing and a fixed grid.

**How is it different from collie, roamgate or herdr-remote?**

These are other phone or browser clients for herdr. This one reads the agent's own transcript, so a pane is a chat with the work folded per turn rather than terminal output, and other PCs join over SSH from the sidebar. It brings no tunnel and drives only herdr: if you want tmux or zellij, diffs, Telegram or a tunnel out of the box, one of the others is the better fit. [The full comparison →](docs/guide.md#faq)

**How is it different from Happy, Paseo or CloudCLI UI?**

Those projects provide their own ways to start or manage agent sessions. This app works with the herdr panes you already run, keeping the same terminals available in the TUI and browser. If you do not use herdr, compare those projects’ deployment options and agent support. [The full comparison →](docs/guide.md#faq)
