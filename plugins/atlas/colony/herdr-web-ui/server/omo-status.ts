/**
 * The status of an OmO pane, read from OmO's own records.
 *
 * herdr reports nothing for one: OmO runs its claude child without the user's settings, so
 * herdr's hook never runs in it, and the pane reads `claude/idle` through a whole turn with no
 * status event (#286: three panes watched for three minutes, no frame). The sidebar never said
 * RUN, a message sent meanwhile was not held, and no done alert came.
 *
 * OmO appends to the session file of the session the pane holds (omo.ts finds it) as a turn
 * goes: a turn is running after a user message, a tool result, an assistant message that
 * stopped for a tool, or one of the runtime's own messages that start a turn (a finished
 * background task, a monitor, a goal continuation); it is over after an assistant message that
 * stopped for good. Measured over 40 session files: each of 492 such runtime messages written at
 * rest was followed by an assistant message, a median of 5 s later, so the message itself is the
 * start. An answer that ended in an error ends the turn like any other: OmO may retry (the next
 * answer followed 2, 4, 8 and 16 s later), but nothing it writes tells a retry from giving up.
 * Its `senpi.hooks.stop-state` record follows 2 ms after an error either way (350 of them were
 * followed by a retry), and is held back while a background task runs, so waiting for it kept a
 * pane at RUN for good. A retry that gets an answer shows as RUN again from that answer. Nothing
 * of OmO's or Claude's is installed or changed for this: files are read.
 *
 * A question OmO asks the user (omo-ask.ts) holds the pane at INPUT while it is open, whatever the
 * turn does: one that waits for its answer stopped the turn for a tool (RUN until now), and one
 * that does not wait lets the turn go on or end (RUN or DONE until now) with the question still
 * open over the input box.
 *
 * The status replaces herdr's for the pane before CompletionTracker sees it, in status events and
 * in snapshots alike, under the one identity `omo`: herdr has named such a pane `pi` and `claude`
 * by turns, and a finish is matched by identity. A pane whose session cannot be told keeps
 * herdr's status, under the same identity.
