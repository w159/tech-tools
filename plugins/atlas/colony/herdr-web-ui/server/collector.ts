/**
 * Collects agent status for EVERY pane in the session, not just the attached ones.
 *
 * herdr's subscription surface (verified against protocol 22):
 * - `pane.agent_status_changed` REQUIRES a pane_id, but one connection carries any
 *   number of per-pane subscriptions, so all panes share a single status connection.
 * - A second `events.subscribe` request on an already-open connection is silently
 *   ignored: when the pane set changes the status connection must be re-opened with
 *   the full set (see `reconcile`).
 * - `pane.created` / `pane.closed` / `pane.exited` subscribe globally (no pane_id)
 *   and drive both the pane-set reconciliation and the structure broadcasts.
 * - `pane.focused` subscribes globally too, and fires for a tab or workspace brought to the
 *   front as well (`{event:"pane_focused", data:{type, pane_id, workspace_id}}`).
 *
 * - herdr (0.9.2+) closes a subscription that fell behind, after an `events_lost` error
 *   that never arrives when the socket's buffer is full (seen on 0.9.3): every connection
 *   here reopens itself on the close alone, and whatever it missed is read back from a
 *   snapshot taken once the new subscription has started (herdr's documented order).
 *
 * - A status that changed while no subscription was listening for the pane is never sent
 *   again: the pane set changed (a pane opened or closed elsewhere) and the status connection
 *   was being reopened with the new set, herdr refused a batch for a pane that had gone, or
 *   the server had only just started. A finish in that gap cost its done alert (#245: with
 *   panes opening and closing beside it, a pane's one status change was lost in 5 of 10
 *   runs). Such a gap is short and known, so the first snapshot after the new subscription
 *   started is measured against each pane's status as last told (by an event, or by an
 *   earlier replay), and a difference is told as that event (`replay`). Nothing else is,
 *   and no other snapshot moves what a pane was last told as: a snapshot at any other time
 *   may differ from the last event for reasons that are no change (herdr reads a finish
 *   nobody saw as `done` here and `idle` there), or be ahead of an event still on its way,
 *   and what was missed over an outage of unknown length (`events_lost`, a herdr that could
 *   not be reached) is corrected without alerts (`onResync`).
 *   The snapshot that shows the pane set changed is such evidence too: the connection is
 *   closed on its account, and an event herdr had sent but this side had not read yet goes
 *   with it (traced: the snapshot already showed `unknown`, the event for it never came).
 *
 * Status frames are flat (`{event:"pane.agent_status_changed", data:{pane_id, agent_status, ...}}`)
 * while structure frames carry a snake_case `data.type` - both shapes below parse only
 * what the live server actually sends.
