# UX Test Swarm

This skill is the single authority for the UX test swarm. It supersedes the old
`docs/claude_testers/RUNBOOK.md` (now a stub). It orchestrates persona generation,
scripted data entry, real-browser walks, fuzzing, and an independent calc oracle, then
enforces three hard gates before reporting a verdict.

You orchestrate and verify only. Never navigate the app, enter data, or edit app source
yourself. The swarm DETECTS and REPORTS app bugs with evidence; it never fixes
`frontend/`/`backend/` code. Your only writes are under `.claude/skills/atlas-expedition/`,
`docs/claude_testers/harness/`, `templates/`, and the run dir.

## Why this exists

A prior run wrote salary to budget/planner tables, read those back, saw HTTP 200, and
declared "COMPLETE" while `profile.current_salary` was null for all personas and the app
showed "needs work". It graded the wrong surface. Every rule below makes the swarm grade
the surface the CLIENT actually reads.

## Invocation options (args -> env knobs)

Parse `key=value` args from the user prompt. Apply defaults for anything omitted, then map
to env knobs passed to `run_all.sh`.

| Option | Values | Default | Env knob |
|---|---|---|---|
| `users` | integer or preset 6/12/24 | `12` | `COUNT` |
| `coverage` | `smoke` / `standard` / `full` | `standard` | `COVERAGE` |
| `profile` | `valid` / `mixed` | `mixed` | `PROFILE` |
| `speed` | `fast` / `thorough` | `fast` | `FAST` (fast -> `FAST=1`) |
| `seed` | integer | random | `GEN_SEED` |

Conflict rule: `smoke` caps users at 2. If the requested `users` exceeds a tier cap (e.g.
`users=24 coverage=smoke`), the coverage cap wins for the user count and you WARN in the
run log (`notes/`) so the discrepancy is visible.

## Coverage tiers (which phases run)

Default is `standard`.

- `smoke`: Discover (cached ok) + Generate (cap users at 2) + Enter data + Verify accuracy.
  No browser walk, no fuzz. Fast sanity check.
- `standard`: smoke phases + Browser walk WITH screenshots over key routes
  (route-matrix priority >= high) + completion metric. No fuzz.
- `full`: standard + Fuzz/boundary + accessibility (axe) scan + every route and every
  field in the matrices.

## Lifecycle (6 phases, in order)

```
0. Discover -> 1. Generate users -> 2. Enter data (scripted) -> 3. Walk UI (browser) ->
4. Fuzz/boundary [full only] -> 5. Verify accuracy (calc oracle) -> 6. Synthesize + gate
```

Each phase records start/end epoch into `RUN_DIR/notes/timing.json`. A phase with no work
for the chosen tier is recorded as `skipped`, never silently absent.

## Phase 0 - discover the app (non-negotiable)

Before ANY data entry, phase 0 must discover the target app from the repo. Do NOT use
baked-in URLs or endpoint constants. All values come from reading the repo.

### 0a. Find the dev URL

Read the repo to discover how and where the app is served in development:
- Check `package.json` scripts (dev, start, serve), `vite.config.ts` / `next.config.js` /
  `angular.json` / `webpack.config.js`, `.env.development`, `.env.local`, `.env`,
  `firebase.json` / `vercel.json` / `netlify.toml`, and any CI scripts that launch the app.
- Extract the hostname and port (e.g. `localhost:5173`, a Firebase Hosting preview URL, a
  Cloud Run URL from `.env.development`).
- If the dev URL cannot be determined from the repo alone, ask the user for it once and
  record it in `RUN_DIR/notes/discovery.json` as `"dev_url_source": "user-provided"`.
- Target the DEV environment only, never production.

### 0b. Find the API base

Read the repo to discover the API base URL used by the frontend:
- Check `frontend/src/utils/api.ts` (or equivalent), `.env.development`, `.env`,
  `vite.config.ts` proxy/rewrite rules, `next.config.js` rewrites, and any config files
  that set `VITE_API_URL`, `REACT_APP_API_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, or equivalent.
- If the app is a SPA with a backend-for-frontend on the same host, the API base may be
  relative (e.g. `/api`); record that.
- If the API base cannot be determined from the repo alone, ask the user for it once.

### 0c. Probe the REAL save/read-back contract

Read `frontend/src` (or equivalent) to capture how the real client persists the primary
onboarding/profile record and reads it back (the surface the dashboard displays). This
probe prevents the swarm from grading the wrong surface:
- Start at the setup/onboarding wizard entry point. Find the component(s) that drive the
  primary data-entry flow (look for `Setup`, `Onboarding`, `Wizard`, or `Profile` in
  component names under the frontend source tree).
- Trace each form submission to its API client call: endpoint, HTTP method, and exact
  payload field names.
- Find the read-back endpoint the client uses to display the submitted values on the
  dashboard or profile screen.
- Record whether any derived value is sent explicitly or assumed computed by the backend.
  Never assume the backend derives a value from another field; verify from source.
- Cite `file:line` for every claim. Write `"unknown"` rather than guess.
- Write the result to `RUN_DIR/coverage/contract-snapshot.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "dev_url": "<discovered or user-provided>",
    "api_base": "<discovered or relative path>",
    "primary_write": {"endpoint": "...", "method": "...", "payload_fields": [...]},
    "secondary_writes": [...],
    "primary_read": {"endpoint": "...", "fields": [...]},
    "derived_fields": {},
    "source_refs": ["file:line", ...]
  }
  ```

### 0d. Coverage cartography

1. Regenerate the route + field coverage matrices from the frontend source (cartographer).
2. Copy both into `RUN_DIR/coverage/` with two extra columns: `status` (init `untested`)
   and `evidence_ref` (empty).

All downstream phases consume `contract-snapshot.json`. If any field in the snapshot is
`"unknown"`, that is a blocker for data entry; resolve it before running phase 2.

See `references/discovery.md`.

## Agent roster

The skill dispatches `general-purpose` subagents, pasting the matching
`references/roles/<role>.md` file as the prompt prefix. Run independent personas and roles
in parallel: one message, multiple Agent dispatches.

| Role file | Runs in tiers |
|---|---|
| `references/roles/cartographer.md` | all (phase 0) |
| `references/roles/scripted-persona.md` | all (phase 2) |
| `references/roles/browser-persona.md` | standard, full (phase 3) |
| `references/roles/fuzz-boundary.md` | full only (phase 4) |
| `references/roles/calc-verifier.md` | all (phase 5) |
| `references/roles/synthesis-reporter.md` | all (phase 6) |

Reconcile every agent claim against the evidence files it cites before accepting it. A
claim with no resolvable evidence path is not a result.

## The three hard gates (synthesis-reporter enforces)

G1 CLIENT-SURFACE SUCCESS. A persona counts as "setup complete" ONLY when the
profile/setup-status endpoint the client reads returns a fully populated record AND, in
standard+/full, a screenshot shows the dashboard cards resolving. HTTP 200 on a write is
necessary, never sufficient. "Route visited" is not "client sees correct data".

G2 EVIDENCE-COMPLETE. Every bug entry MUST carry: before + after screenshot path, repro
steps, expected-vs-actual, Nielsen severity, route + selector, persona id. Missing any
field rejects the entry and flags the run. User-stories and persona-feedback each link at
least one screenshot.

G3 ACCURACY. Every client-facing number is independently recomputed (pseudo-oracle) AND
checked against at least one metamorphic relation. Any mismatch beyond a 1-cent tolerance
is a Blocker. Release gate: zero unresolved Nielsen-4 (Blocker) and zero accuracy
mismatches.

Headline metric = completion rate (personas meeting G1 / total). Counts in every report
MUST reconcile with files on disk; `aggregate_results.py` asserts this.

## Run setup

1. Run phase 0 (discover) first. All URLs and contracts come from discovery, not from
   constants in this file.
2. Create `docs/claude_testers/run-YYYYMMDD[-nn]/` with subdirs
   `coverage/ harness/ evidence/ notes/ reports/`. If `run-YYYYMMDD` exists for today,
   suffix `-02`, `-03`, and so on (the unsuffixed dir is the day's first run).
3. Copy `docs/claude_testers/harness/` into the run's `harness/`.
4. If a previous run exists, read its `reports/bug-log.md` (and `coverage-report.md` where
   present) first; those findings become explicit regression targets in the agent briefs.
5. Run the swarm through `RUN_DIR/harness/run_all.sh` with the mapped env knobs, e.g.
   `COUNT=12 COVERAGE=standard PROFILE=mixed FAST=1 GEN_SEED=<seed> bash run_all.sh`.

No agent deletes data it did not create. The user purges test accounts; you never delete.
List the test accounts created (`notes/test-accounts-created.txt`) when you report back.

## Reporting back

Lead with the synthesis reporter's verdict and headline completion rate, name the single
most important finding, and point to `RUN_DIR/reports/` by path. If the verdict is
INCOMPLETE, dispatch targeted agents to close the named gaps and re-run synthesis; do not
report a run as done with open gaps.
