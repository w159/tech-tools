"""Scaffold + repair the full canonical docs/ + .atlas/ + root-file structure.

Creates every tree from templates/, all idempotent: creates only what is
missing, never overwrites an existing non-empty file. Safe to re-run on a
partially-scaffolded repo (repair) as well as an empty one. Invoked by
atlas-setup as:

    python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/scaffold_docs.py" <repo-root>

where <repo-root> defaults to the current working directory.

SSOT contract (see atlas-loop/references/docs-ssot.md, authoritative):
  <root>/      -- README.md, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md: human/agent entry points.
  docs/        -- the project wiki. Minimum: CHANGELOG.md, ROADMAP.md,
                  AGENTS.md, plus always-applicable base subfolders
                  (architecture/, decisions/, plans/, specs/, features/,
                  lessons/, wiki/). Project-adaptive: api/ + endpoints.md,
                  created only when an API signal is detected.
  .atlas/      -- atlas's own auditable operational state for self-improvement:
                  evidence/, findings/ (+ INDEX.md), audits/, decisions/,
                  archive/, understand-anything/, graphify/, self-improvement/,
                  memory/, nudge/, plus CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md orientation.
                  .run/ is the only ephemeral subtree.
  .atlas/      -- NEVER contains project wiki content (architecture, plans,
                  specs, lessons, wiki, features, reference). Those belong in
                  docs/. A leftover .atlas/ with any of those subdirs is a
                  defect. (.atlas/audits/ and .atlas/decisions/ ARE legitimate
                  atlas-internal names, distinct from their docs/ namesakes.)
  <root>/.gitignore -- ensured present; content is owned by the

## Tool Routing

Minimum tooling bar for this project, wired by atlas-setup. Do not read/grep
source or shell out for things these tools already do:

- **claude-mem** -- cross-session memory. Search it before re-discovering
  something a prior session already worked out.
- **context-mode** -- context-window protection for noisy output (build/test
  logs, large command output, web fetches). Route anything over ~20 lines
  through it instead of raw shell into context.
- **serena** + **lean-ctx** -- the code-nav pair for this tree. serena for
  code symbols (definitions, references, call graphs); lean-ctx for shaped
  file/tree access, search, and edits on everything else (prose, config,
  markdown). Native Read/Grep on source is a fallback only when both are
  unreachable, never a first choice.
- **ponytail** -- simplicity discipline; keep changes minimal and avoid
  speculative abstraction.

Run `atlas-doctor` to check whether this project's tooling is actually
wired (`context-tooling` check) and whether it is doing its job (session
cache-hit ratio, per-tool error rate).
