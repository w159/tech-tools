# Plugin repair (atlas-setup mode)

Atlas can be silently broken from the outside: a marketplace entry that points
at a stale fork with autoUpdate on will roll the installed plugin back to an
old version on every update, and the subagent engine, hooks, and skills vanish
without any error. This command detects that class of failure and repairs it.

## Run the diagnosis

```!
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/atlas_doctor.py" ${ARGUMENTS}
```

## Interpret the output

The script prints one PASS/FAIL line per check and exits 0 (healthy) or 1
(problems found):

| Check | What it proves |
|---|---|
| registered | atlas is present in installed_plugins.json |
| marketplace-source | known_marketplaces.json tracks the repo named in the plugin's own manifest (the canonical source), not a fork |
| clone-remote | the marketplace git clone's origin matches the canonical repo |
| version-sync | installed version equals what the marketplace currently offers |
| rollback | installed version is not below the highest version ever seen (state in ~/.atlas/doctor-state.json) |
| install-path | the cache copy exists, matches the registered version, and is not marked .orphaned_at for garbage collection |
| hooks-wired | every hook file referenced by hooks.json exists in the installed copy |
| assets | `agents/` and `skills/` are populated in the installed copy |

## If problems are found

1. Report each FAIL line to the user verbatim with a one-sentence explanation.
2. If the user passed `--fix`, the script already attempted repair and re-ran
   the checks (its second block of output is the VERIFY pass). Otherwise ask
   whether to run it again with `--fix`.
3. `--fix` repoints the marketplace source and clone remote to the canonical
   repo, resets the clone, re-registers the marketplace's current version in
   installed_plugins.json (staging the cache copy if needed), and clears any
   .orphaned_at markers.
4. After a successful fix, tell the user to run `/reload-plugins` (or restart
   the session) - the running session keeps the old plugin loaded until then.
5. If FAILs persist after `--fix`, show the exact failing lines and stop; do
   not hand-edit plugin manager state beyond what the script does.

**Scope of `--fix`:** it repairs plugin/marketplace install state only. It
does not repair MCP registrations or installations - a missing or
misregistered claude-mem, context-mode, ponytail, serena, or lean-ctx entry
is out of its reach for all of them equally (there is no per-tool MCP
remediation path in the doctor). The repair for those is the install
command from `discover_capabilities.py` / `references/install.md` Stage 1,
run with the user's explicit OK; session boot announces the trio gap via its
"Setup gap: ... absent" line.

The same checks also run automatically at SessionStart in warn-only mode, so a
future rollback announces itself at the top of the session instead of
silently degrading atlas.

## Supporting files
- `references/checks-matrix.md` - the eight checks, what each proves, what a
  FAIL means, the additional surface checks (frontmatter validity, skill/agent
  count vs manifest, `docs/` tree presence), the SessionStart warn-only mode,
  and why doctor is not itself a skill.
- `skills/atlas-setup/scripts/plugin-health.py` - a deterministic, read-only count of skills and
  agents in the installed copy compared against the manifest's declared
  counts. Exits 0 if counts match, 1 if they differ. A quick sanity check
  between full doctor runs; does not repair.
