description: Shared engineering operating contract for the atlas plugin - the verify-loop (research, document, implement, verify, report), anti-hallucination grounding, and conduct standards that every atlas-* command applies. Invoke to inject these standards into the current task; the atlas-* commands also pull it in automatically.

Apply this Operating Contract to the current task and for the rest of the session.

```!
cat "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/atlas-engine/references/operating-contract.md"
```
