# Scaffolding

Where artifacts live. The rule that prevents clutter: **scope everything to where it belongs, never to a parent that holds multiple projects.**

Artifacts live in two separate trees at the codebase root: `docs/` (the project wiki) and `.atlas/` (atlas's own internal state - evidence, run state, findings, audits, decisions). Neither is nested inside the other. See `docs-ssot.md` for the full contract of who writes what and when; this file is the layout, root-detection, and findings.json-schema detail it delegates to.

## Detect three levels first

1. **Workspace root**: a directory that contains *multiple unrelated projects* (e.g. a `Projects/` or `Web_Projects/` folder). **Never scaffold here.** If the skill is invoked from such a parent, identify which project the task targets and descend into it; if ambiguous, ask.
2. **Project root**: the unit of work, the git repository root, or the single app dir. Detection: nearest ancestor with `.git`.
3. **Codebase roots**: subdirectories with their *own* manifest (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `composer.json`, ...). A monorepo has several (e.g. `frontend/`, `backend/`, `admin-webapp/`, `functions/`). Detection: descendants (depth <= 3, excluding `node_modules`/`.venv*`/`dist`/`build`) containing a manifest.

`docs/` and `.atlas/` live at the **codebase root** the task targets, not at a multi-project parent. A single-app repo has one codebase root (= project root) and one `docs/` + one `.atlas/`. A monorepo gets its own pair under whichever codebase root the work touches; respect any existing layout the repo already has. Confirm the chosen root in the orientation summary before creating anything.

## Artifact layout

```
<codebase-root>/docs/                 # project wiki: committed, project-adaptive (create if absent)
|-- CHANGELOG.md          # append-only, newest-first; everything done/changed
|-- ROADMAP.md            # everything still to be done; backlog with status
|-- AGENTS.md             # deep orienting guidance beyond the root AGENTS.md (optional)
|-- architecture/         # system design, component maps, data flows
|-- decisions/            # project ADRs
|-- plans/                # implementation plans, one per task
|-- specs/                # requirements and specifications (pre-build intent)
|-- features/             # per-feature specs-as-built: what it does, where it lives, how it is tested
|-- lessons/              # durable lessons learned, gotchas, postmortems, why-we-did-X
|-- wiki/                 # rendered, human-facing graphify diagrams and understand-anything output
`-- api/                  # OpenAPI/Swagger specs + endpoints.md - only if the project has an API

<codebase-root>/.atlas/                # atlas internal state: mostly committed (create if absent)
|-- evidence/             # COMMITTED permanent execution-evidence; one dir per item: <YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>/
|-- findings/             # COMMITTED dated learning ledger: <YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md + INDEX.md
|-- audits/               # COMMITTED atlas-internal audit records, <YYYY-MM-DD>-<scope>/
|-- decisions/            # COMMITTED atlas's own operating decisions, <YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md
|-- archive/              # COMMITTED retired/superseded state: old run logs, deprecated findings, prior structure snapshots
|-- understand-anything/  # COMMITTED working data for the understand-anything skill
|-- graphify/             # COMMITTED working data for the graphify skill
|-- self-improvement/     # COMMITTED skill generation/disabling decisions, context-optimizer output
|-- memory/                # COMMITTED persistent memory for cross-session self-improvement
|-- nudge/                 # COMMITTED nudge data: inline-op thresholds, dispatch coaching signals
`-- .run/                 # EPHEMERAL, GITIGNORED run state (except findings.json, see below)
    |-- STATE.md          #   live: current wave, open subagents, decisions, next wave
    |-- findings.json     #   COMMITTED durable ledger, machine-readable, one object per finding (schema below)
    `-- work-log.md       #   resumability log; re-read before any continuation
```

Per-codebase knowledge graphs stay scoped per root:

```
<each codebase root>/graphify-out/    # per-stack knowledge graph (via the graphify skill, scoped to that root)
```

Rules:
- `docs/` is fully **committed**. `.atlas/` is committed except `.atlas/.run/`, which is ephemeral and gitignored - with one exception: `.atlas/.run/findings.json` is re-included and committed because it is the durable verification ledger. Add `.atlas/.run/` to the repo's `.gitignore`, then re-allowlist `!.atlas/.run/findings.json`.
- One `docs/` and one `.atlas/` per codebase root. Respect an existing layout if the repo already has one; merge into it rather than duplicating.
- `.atlas/` never holds project wiki content (`architecture/`, `plans/`, `specs/`, `features/`) or a `docs/` subdirectory. A leftover `.atlas/docs/` is a defect - move its content into `docs/` or the right `.atlas/` subfolder and delete it.
- `graphify-out/` is **per codebase root** (run `graphify` scoped to each root, not the whole tree).
- Never write artifacts above the codebase root.
- For a trivial single-shot task you may skip `.atlas/.run/` scaffolding (use judgment); scaffold when the work spans multiple waves or you need to persist findings. The durable subfolders are still updated for any shipping change (see "Living-docs discipline").

## findings.json schema (one object per finding)

Lives at `.atlas/.run/findings.json`. One object per finding:

```json
{
  "id": "BE-014",
  "surface": "frontend|admin|backend|database|infra|claude-code-setup",
  "category": "correctness|security|reliability|performance|maintainability|setup",
  "severity": "critical|high|medium|low",
  "title": "one line",
  "evidence": ["path/file.py:L42-58", ".atlas/evidence/2026-06-15-test-x/run.log", "screenshot.png"],
  "doc_refs": ["context7: fastapi 0.115 / security"],
  "reproduction": "exact command or test that demonstrates it",
  "proposed_fix": "concise",
  "blast_radius": "single-file|module|cross-service|schema",
  "status": "verified|rejected|needs-evidence|open"
}
```

Do not hand-write this file. Append entries with the CLI, which does an atomic write and
cannot corrupt the ledger - and which `atlas:verifier` can run even though it has no
`Write` tool:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/atlas_finding.py" \
  --id S3 --status verified --title "one line" \
  --evidence "backend/tests/test_budget.py::test_multi_income" \
  --reproduction "pytest backend/tests/test_budget.py -q"
```

The `status` enum is `verified | rejected | needs-evidence | open`. A finding starts `open`, becomes `needs-evidence` when it lacks a reproduction or capture, and resolves to `verified` or `rejected` only through a separate verifier context. Bulky evidence referenced from a finding is committed under `.atlas/evidence/`, not inlined. The curator later distills `verified` entries into the dated `.atlas/findings/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md` history.

## Living-docs discipline

Any change to user-visible behavior, a public API, or an operator workflow updates `docs/CHANGELOG.md` (what shipped, newest-first) and reconciles `docs/ROADMAP.md` (move done items out, add follow-ups) as part of the same wave. A code change without its doc update is incomplete. Every affected durable subfolder (`docs/architecture/`, `docs/features/`, `docs/lessons/`, `docs/wiki/`, and `.atlas/findings/`, `.atlas/audits/`, `.atlas/decisions/`) is updated too. Keep `docs/AGENTS.md` current with discovered stacks, the real gate commands, and gotchas, so the next session orients in seconds. This is the "docs-current" state the completion gate enforces, see `docs-ssot.md`.
