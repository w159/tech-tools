# LSP & Symbol Intelligence

The single biggest token lever in a long run is **never reading a file you can query**. A
language server (or `serena`) answers "where is this defined / who calls it / what's the
signature / does this edit type-check" with one structured call that replaces 3–10 full-file
reads — and the bytes never enter context. This is law 1 (protect your context) made concrete.

## What's available, in priority order

1. **`serena` MCP** — symbol-level navigation and edits across many languages, plus its own
   memory. Primary tool when connected:
   - `get_symbols_overview` — the shape of a file without reading it.
   - `find_symbol` / `find_referencing_symbols` — definition and all callers.
   - `replace_symbol_body` / `insert_after_symbol` — surgical edits by symbol, not line math.
   - `get_diagnostics_for_file` — post-edit type/lint errors straight from the language server.
2. **The native `LSP` tool** — when a language server is wired for the active language, use it
   for go-to-definition, find-references, hover/signature, and diagnostics. One call, no read.
3. **LSP plugins** (`enabledPlugins`) — `typescript-lsp`, `pyright-lsp`, `gopls-lsp`,
   `rust-analyzer-lsp`, etc. They add automatic post-edit diagnostics for their language. If a
   language is in active use and its LSP plugin is **absent**, that gap is itself a finding →
   `references/claude-code-tuning.md`.
4. **`smart-explore` skill** — tree-sitter AST structure when you want shape without an LSP.

Avoid stacking redundant navigation. If `serena` already covers a language well this session,
don't also spin up a second symbol MCP for it — note what's live in Orient and route to one.

## The hard rule for every navigating subagent

Put this directive in the dispatch spec for any explore/implement/review/verify job on an
LSP-capable language:

> Use find-references / go-to-definition / symbol-overview (serena or the LSP tool), **not**
> grep-then-read. Read a full file body only as a last resort, and only the relevant span.
> After any edit, check LSP diagnostics for the touched file before reporting done.

`grep` + `Read` is the anti-pattern: it pulls whole files into context to answer a question a
symbol call answers structurally. Reserve raw grep for genuinely non-semantic searches (a
string in config, a TODO sweep) and route even those through `context-mode` when noisy.

## Keeping generated/vendor bytes out of context entirely

LSP discipline is undermined if build artifacts can still be read into context. Pair it with
`permissions.deny` Read rules (apply via `references/claude-code-tuning.md`):

```
Read(./**/dist/**)   Read(./**/build/**)   Read(./**/*.generated.*)
Read(./**/node_modules/**)   Read(./**/.venv*/**)   Read(./vendor/**)
```

## The post-edit diagnostics loop (verify by the language server, not by eye)

After `atlas:implementer` (or any editor) makes a change, the cheapest real verification is the
language server's own diagnostics on the edited file:

1. Edit by symbol (`replace_symbol_body`) or minimal Edit.
2. Pull diagnostics for that file (`get_diagnostics_for_file` / the LSP tool / the LSP plugin's
   automatic post-edit report).
3. A clean diagnostics pass is necessary-but-not-sufficient — still run the project's real gate
   (typecheck/lint/test/build, derived from manifests) per `references/execution-testing.md`.
   "Type-checks" is not "works"; observed behavior is the final word.

If no LSP/diagnostics capability exists for a language in active use, record that absence as a
finding and route to `claude-code-tuning.md` — don't silently fall back to read-everything.
