# Capability catalog

Maps a detected project signal to the asset Atlas recommends installing. The
`/atlas` architect runs `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/discover_capabilities.py` (read-only) to detect
the signals, then presents matching rows here for confirmation. Nothing installs
without the user's explicit OK.

Columns: signal, asset, type (skill / plugin / mcp), why, install command.

| Signal | Asset | Type | Why | Install command |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Any multi-session repo | claude-mem | plugin | Persist lessons, decisions, and errors across sessions; backs the self-improvement layer. | `claude plugin install claude-mem` |
| Logs present or any file over 1 MB | context-mode | plugin | Process large command output and files in a sandbox so raw bytes stay out of context. | `claude plugin install context-mode` |
| 8+ third-party deps in package.json | context7 | mcp | Live, version-correct library docs instead of guessing from memory. | `claude mcp add context7 -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp` |
| react / vue / svelte / next / angular | playwright | mcp | Drive a real browser for runtime UI checks and end-to-end tests. | `claude mcp add playwright -- npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest` |
| Frontend framework present | ui-ux-pro-max | skill | Design-system, palette, and UX-guideline intelligence for UI work. | `claude plugin install ui-ux-pro-max` |
| .ps1 / .csproj / .sln (Microsoft stack) | microsoft-docs | mcp | Official Microsoft/Azure/Graph docs grounding. | `claude mcp add microsoft-docs -- npx -y @microsoft/mcp-docs` |
| .tf files (Terraform / IaC) | iac skill | skill | Infra-aware generation and review for Terraform. | `claude plugin install <iac-skill>` |
| Dockerfile / compose / k8s manifests | container tooling | skill | Container build and deploy awareness. | `claude plugin install <container-skill>` |
| .sql / Prisma / Drizzle schema | atlas:db-prober (built in) | agent | Use the bundled read-only DB prober for schema, RLS, grants, indexes, and EXPLAIN plans. | (already shipped with atlas) |
| CI files (.github/workflows, gitlab-ci) | (review awareness) | note | Make reviews CI-aware; mirror the pipeline's lint/test/build gate locally. | (no install; routing note) |
| Any multi-session repo | ponytail | plugin | Lazy-senior-dev mode: writes far less code (~54% less, ~20% cheaper) while keeping safety. Session-augmentation tier with claude-mem/context-mode. | `copilot plugin marketplace add DietrichGebert/ponytail` then `copilot plugin install ponytail@ponytail` |
| Recurring or iterative task | loop-library (via atlas-orbit) | note | Built-in curated loops; use the atlas-orbit skill to pick and instantiate one. | (already shipped with atlas) |
| MSP/vendor signals (mcp_servers/, *.mcpb, vendor API usage) | connectors (via atlas-harbor) | note | Built-in vendor MCP connectors, disabled by default; use atlas-harbor to enable. | (already shipped with atlas) |
| Architecture review / codebase structure unclear / structural duplication suspected | atlas-cartographer | note | Produces an evidence-grounded architecture map and writes docs/architecture/boundaries.md; identifies structural duplicates so the orchestrator routes edits to the right layer. | (already shipped with atlas) |
| Code quality audit / security scan / OWASP check / pre-release hardening review | atlas-survey | note | Discovery-first multi-swarm audit: quality, security (OWASP Top 10 + SANS 25), coverage, and severity-graded remediation plan. No hardcoded file paths; works on any codebase. | (already shipped with atlas) |
| Frontend app needs UX validation / pre-release UX sweep / app routes unknown | atlas-expedition | note | App-discovering UX swarm: auto-finds routes and form fields in the live app, then runs cartographer -> persona -> fuzzer -> oracle -> reporter without needing hardcoded paths. | (already shipped with atlas) |

Maintenance: when the discovery script learns a new signal, add a row here with the
same signal wording the script emits, so the two stay in lockstep. Placeholder
asset names in angle brackets mean Atlas should resolve the current best plugin at
recommend time rather than hardcode a slug that may move.
