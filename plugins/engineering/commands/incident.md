description: Run an incident response workflow - triage, communicate, and write postmortem
argument-hint: "<incident description or alert>"

# /incident

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../CONNECTORS.md).

Manage an incident from detection through postmortem.

## Usage

```
/incident $ARGUMENTS
```

## Modes

```
/incident new [description]     # Start a new incident
/incident update [status]       # Post a status update
/incident postmortem            # Generate postmortem from incident data
```

If no mode is specified, ask what phase the incident is in. See the **incident-response** skill for severity definitions, response frameworks, and communication templates.

## How It Works

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
|                    INCIDENT RESPONSE                               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Phase 1: TRIAGE                                                  |
|  [x] Assess severity (SEV1-4)                                     |
|  [x] Identify affected systems and users                          |
|  [x] Assign roles (IC, comms, responders)                         |
|                                                                    |
|  Phase 2: COMMUNICATE                                              |
|  [x] Draft internal status update                                  |
|  [x] Draft customer communication (if needed)                     |
|  [x] Set up war room and cadence                                   |
|                                                                    |
|  Phase 3: MITIGATE                                                 |
|  [x] Document mitigation steps taken                               |
|  [x] Track timeline of events                                      |
|  [x] Confirm resolution                                            |
|                                                                    |
|  Phase 4: POSTMORTEM                                               |
|  [x] Blameless postmortem document                                 |
|  [x] Timeline reconstruction                                       |
|  [x] Root cause analysis (5 whys)                                  |
|  [x] Action items with owners                                      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+

## If Connectors Available

If **~~monitoring** is connected:
- Pull alert details and metrics
- Show graphs of affected metrics

If **~~incident management** is connected:
- Create or update incident in PagerDuty/Opsgenie
- Page on-call responders

If **~~chat** is connected:
- Post status updates to incident channel
- Create war room channel

## Tips

1. **Start writing immediately**  -  Don't wait for complete information. Update as you learn more.
2. **Keep updates factual**  -  What we know, what we've done, what's next. No speculation.
3. **Postmortems are blameless**  -  Focus on systems and processes, not individuals.
