"""Stop hook — the orchestrate "Definition of done" gate (opt-in).

The orchestrate skill's hardest rule is that a change is not *done* until observed
behavior is captured AND an independent agent has verified it. Prose alone does not
enforce this (the orchestrator rationalizes "I'll mark it unverified and move on").
This hook is the machine backstop.

It is **scoped**: it only engages when the working directory holds an `.orchestrator/`
state dir — i.e. an orchestrate run is actually in progress. In any other session it is
a silent no-op, so it is safe to leave installed. When a run IS active and the
orchestrator tries to stop without having captured any evidence, it blocks the stop
ONCE (the `stop_hook_active` loop-guard) and reminds it to produce the proof or say
explicitly what is unverified.

What counts as "evidence captured": at least one file under `.orchestrator/evidence/`,
OR a `findings.json` that records a `verified` entry. Either satisfies the gate — the
hook checks that *something* was observed and verified, not that the work is perfect.

Fail-open by construction: any error, missing dir, or unparseable input lets the stop
proceed. Disable entirely with ORCHESTRATE_GATE=off. Off by default — installed only
via `install_hooks.py --select completion-gate --apply`.

Stdlib only.
