# NinjaOne Device Management

Manage NinjaRMM-enrolled endpoints: query details, control Windows services, schedule maintenance, and reboot devices safely.

## Core API Operations

### Get Device Details

```http
GET /api/v2/device/{id}
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

Response (key fields):

```json
{
  "id": 42, "systemName": "WS-ACCT-017",
  "offline": false, "lastContact": "2025-04-10T14:32:00Z",
  "os": { "name": "Windows 11 Pro" },
  "nodeRoleId": 1, "organizationId": 5, "policyId": 12
}
```

### Update Device

```http
PATCH /api/v2/device/{id}
Authorization: Bearer {token}
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{ "displayName": "WS-ACCT-017-Renamed", "nodeRoleId": 2, "policyId": 45 }
```

### Get Device Alerts / Activities

```http
GET /api/v2/device/{id}/alerts
GET /api/v2/device/{id}/activities
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

## Windows Services

```http
GET  /api/v2/device/{id}/windows-services                          # list all
POST /api/v2/device/{id}/windows-service/{serviceId}/control       # control
Authorization: Bearer {token}
Content-Type: application/json
```

Control body  -  actions: `START`, `STOP`, `RESTART`:

```json
{ "action": "RESTART" }
```

If the service does not exist, the API returns 404. Verify `serviceId` by listing services first.

## Maintenance Windows

```http
PUT    /api/v2/device/{id}/maintenance    # schedule
DELETE /api/v2/device/{id}/maintenance    # cancel
Authorization: Bearer {token}
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{ "start": "2025-04-16T02:00:00Z", "end": "2025-04-16T06:00:00Z" }
```

## Reboot Device

```http
POST /api/v2/device/{id}/reboot/{mode}
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

Modes: `NORMAL` (graceful, notifies user) | `FORCED` (immediate, no warning).

> **Destructive operation**  -  always validate before rebooting. See safe-reboot workflow below.

## Workflows

### Safe Reboot with Validation

```text
1. GET /api/v2/device/{id}           -> assert "offline": false
2. GET /api/v2/device/{id}/alerts    -> review severity; abort if critical
3. POST /api/v2/device/{id}/reboot/NORMAL
4. Poll GET /api/v2/device/{id} every 30s (up to 10 min) -> wait for "offline": false
5. If still offline after 10 min -> GET /api/v2/device/{id}/alerts for new alerts; escalate
```

**Error recovery**: If step 1 shows `"offline": true`, do not reboot. Check `lastContact` and alerts to diagnose.

### Restart a Windows Service

```text
1. GET /api/v2/device/{id}/windows-services -> find target service, note serviceId
2. If state is "STOPPED", use "START"; otherwise use "RESTART"
3. POST /api/v2/device/{id}/windows-service/{serviceId}/control  Body: { "action": "RESTART" }
4. GET /api/v2/device/{id}/windows-services -> confirm state is "RUNNING"
```

**Error recovery**: 404 means wrong `serviceId`  -  re-list and match by `serviceName` (case-sensitive). 409 means device offline  -  check device status first.

### Check Server Health

```text
1. GET /api/v2/device/{id}                  -> confirm online, note OS and role
2. GET /api/v2/device/{id}/volumes          -> flag volumes with < 10% free space
3. GET /api/v2/device/{id}/alerts           -> triage by severity
4. GET /api/v2/device/{id}/windows-services -> verify critical services are RUNNING
```

## Best Practices

1. **Check `offline` before issuing commands**  -  control requests to offline devices return 409.
2. **Default to `NORMAL` reboot**  -  `FORCED` skips user notification and risks data loss.
3. **Poll after destructive operations**  -  confirm device/service status at 30s intervals before proceeding.
4. **Scope maintenance windows tightly**  -  minimize alert suppression gaps.
