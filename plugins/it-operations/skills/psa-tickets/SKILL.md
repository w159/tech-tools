# ConnectWise PSA Ticket Management

Tickets are the core unit of service delivery in ConnectWise PSA. Every client request, incident, and change flows through `POST /service/tickets`. This skill covers creating, searching, updating, and closing tickets with proper SLA handling.

> For complete field definitions see [FIELDS.md](./FIELDS.md). For status values, priorities, SLA tables, and note types see [REFERENCE.md](./REFERENCE.md).

## Core API Operations

### Create a Ticket

```http
POST /service/tickets
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "summary": "Unable to access email - multiple users affected",
  "board": {"id": 1},
  "company": {"id": 12345},
  "contact": {"id": 67890},
  "priority": {"id": 2},
  "status": {"name": "New"},
  "initialDescription": "Sales team (5 users) reporting Outlook disconnected since 9am. Webmail working."
}
```

Required fields: `summary`, `board`, `company`. Use `initialDescription` for the first note with full details.

### Get / Update a Ticket

```http
GET /service/tickets/{id}
```

```http
PATCH /service/tickets/{id}
Content-Type: application/json

{"status": {"name": "In Progress"}, "owner": {"id": 123}}
```

### Add a Note

```http
POST /service/tickets/{ticketId}/notes
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "text": "Identified the issue as a DNS configuration problem.",
  "internalAnalysisFlag": true,
  "resolutionFlag": false
}
```

Set `resolutionFlag: true` for resolution notes visible to the customer on close.

### Search Tickets

```http
GET /service/tickets?conditions=company/id=12345 and status/name!="Closed"&orderBy=priority/id asc
```

## Common Query Patterns

```
# Open tickets for a company
conditions=company/id=12345 and closedFlag=false

# High priority open tickets
conditions=priority/id<=2 and closedFlag=false

# Tickets by date range
conditions=dateEntered>=[2024-01-01] and dateEntered<[2024-02-01]

# SLA-breached tickets
conditions=_info/sla_resolve_by<[2024-02-15T12:00:00Z] and closedFlag=false

# My assigned tickets
conditions=resources contains "jsmith" and closedFlag=false
```

## Workflow: Ticket Closure with Validation

Follow these checkpoints before closing any ticket:

1. **Verify resolution exists**  -  `GET /service/tickets/{id}` and confirm `resolution` field is populated. If empty, add a resolution note first (`resolutionFlag: true`).
2. **Check time entries**  -  `GET /time/entries?conditions=chargeToId={id} and chargeToType="ServiceTicket"`. Ensure all work is logged.
3. **Confirm status is Completed**  -  Tickets must pass through `Completed` before `Closed`. Set status to `Completed` first if still `In Progress` or waiting.
4. **Close the ticket:**
   ```http
   PATCH /service/tickets/{id}
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "status": {"name": "Closed"},
     "closedFlag": true,
     "resolution": "DNS records corrected; email service restored for all affected users."
   }
   ```
5. **Validate closure**  -  `GET /service/tickets/{id}` and confirm `closedFlag: true` and `closedDate` is populated.

> If any checkpoint fails, stop and resolve the issue before proceeding. Closing without a resolution note will leave the ticket incomplete in reports.

## Best Practices

1. **Always specify board**  -  determines available statuses, workflows, and SLA rules.
2. **Set accurate priority**  -  use impact/urgency; Priority 1 = highest (business down). See [REFERENCE.md](./REFERENCE.md) for the matrix.
3. **Search before creating**  -  check for duplicates with `conditions=company/id={id} and summary contains "keyword"`.
4. **Update status promptly**  -  keeps SLA clocks accurate and queues reliable.
