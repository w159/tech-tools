## Ticket Status Values

Status values are configurable per board. Query `GET /service/boards/{id}/statuses` for board-specific values.

| Status | SLA Clock | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| `New` | Running | Awaiting triage |
| `In Progress` | Running | Actively being worked |
| `Waiting Customer` | Paused | Awaiting client response |
| `Waiting Vendor` | Paused | Awaiting third-party |
| `Waiting Parts` | Paused | Awaiting hardware/materials |
| `Waiting Scheduling` | Running | Needs to be scheduled |
| `Completed` | Stopped | Issue resolved |
| `Closed` | Stopped | Only after Completed |

### Status Transition Rules

```

## Ticket Priority Levels

Lower number = higher priority. **Priority 1 is the most urgent** (opposite to some other PSA systems).

| ID | Name | Response SLA | Resolution SLA | Use Case |
|----|------|--------------|----------------|----------|
| 1 | Critical | 1 hour | 4 hours | Business down, all users affected |
| 2 | High | 2 hours | 8 hours | Major impact, no workaround |
| 3 | Medium | 4 hours | 24 hours | Single user or workaround exists |
| 4 | Low | 8 hours | 72 hours | Minor issue, enhancement request |

---

## Service Boards

Boards organize tickets by type and workflow. Query available boards: `GET /service/boards`.

| Board | Purpose | Typical Flow |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| Service Desk | General support | New > In Progress > Completed |
| Projects | Project work | Linked to project tickets |
| Managed Services | Monitoring alerts | Alert > Triage > Resolution |
| Sales | Pre-sales engineering | Request > Quote > Won/Lost |

Get board-specific statuses: `GET /service/boards/{boardId}/statuses`
