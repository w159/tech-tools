# Standards Reference Library

Best-practice rulebooks, mostly extracted from the awesome-copilot `instructions/` corpus
plus a small number of in-house standards written for this repo. These are reference
documents, not auto-imported context. They are deliberately kept out of `rules/`
(which `AGENTS.md` expands into every session) so they do not bloat the session context. Agents
and skills consult them on demand when the work touches a given domain.

## Provenance

Source: `awesome-copilot/instructions/*.instructions.md` (the `.instructions.md` suffix and the
VS Code `applyTo` frontmatter were the only Copilot-specific parts; content is plain markdown).
Extracted 2026-06-03 during the workspace consolidation.

`connector-safety-signals.md` is in-house, written 2026-09-17 from the connector annotation
audit; it is not from the awesome-copilot corpus.
