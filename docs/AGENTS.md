# Atlas Subagent Roster

Authoritative list of subagents shipped in `plugins/atlas/agents/`. 12 agents total as of the
2026-07-07 UX-swarm and api-usage-map removal (formerly 18 as of v2.2.1).
Source: `plugins/atlas/agents/*.md` (each file's `name:` and `description:` frontmatter fields).

The atlas plugin ships 12 core agents (listed below). The v5.0.0 split moved 11 additional
`atlas:armada-*` department agents out of atlas and into a separate `armada` plugin
(`plugins/armada/agents/`), which is part of the Claude Code marketplace but is installed
alongside `atlas` only for org deployment. The 11 armada department agents are:
`atlas:armada-data`, `atlas:armada-design`, `atlas:armada-engineering`,
`atlas:armada-finance`, `atlas:armada-hr`, `atlas:armada-it-ops`, `atlas:armada-m365`,
`atlas:armada-product`, `atlas:armada-productivity`, `atlas:armada-security`, and
`atlas:armada-support`. They are NOT in `plugins/atlas/agents/` and are not part of the

## How to Run Agents

Atlas skills invoke these agents via the Claude Code `Agent` tool with `subagent_type` set to
the agent's canonical name (e.g. `atlas:explorer`). The orchestrating skill or the user's atlas
session dispatches them; agents never invoke each other directly. Skills themselves are invoked
via the `Skill` tool or directly with `/atlas:<skill-name>`.

---

## Orchestrator vs. Worker Sessions

Every session is one of two kinds:

- **Orchestrator**: the main session that holds the user's task, dispatches subagents, synthesizes
  results, and keeps lean context by delegating heavy reads and writes to workers. The `atlas`
  session started by the user is always an orchestrator. Orchestrators track dispatches and
  verifier coverage in the `runs` and `metrics` tables of the observability DB.

- **Worker**: a leaf subagent session spawned by the orchestrator to do one bounded piece of work
  (exploration, implementation, verification, a DB audit query, etc.). Workers have narrow context,
  do not dispatch further, and report findings back to the orchestrator. A single orchestrator run
  may open dozens of worker sessions.

The observability DB (`~/.atlas/atlas.db`) records every session's transcript in the `session_logs`,
`messages`, and `tool_calls` mirror tables (added in v2.2.1). v2.2.3 added a `run_kind` (orchestrator/worker) tag to the `runs` table, so atlas-audit Trends
run-health aggregates now exclude leaf worker sessions, preventing short worker sessions from
skewing wall-clock or context averages (`plugins/atlas/scripts/atlas_db.py:128,131`;
`docs/ROADMAP.md:143`).

## Core Pipeline Agents

These five agents form the standard orchestrator dispatch pattern:
explorer -> planner -> implementer -> verifier -> completeness-critic.

| Agent | One-line role |
|---|---|
| **atlas:explorer** | Read-only codebase explorer: maps features, modules, and call paths; returns a compact structural map with file:line references; never file dumps. |
| **atlas:planner** | Multi-stage decomposition specialist: turns a task into a numbered stage map where each stage has exactly one failable check; flags concurrent stages and marks unverifiable output explicitly. |
| **atlas:implementer** | Focused implementer: makes ONE bounded, well-specified change correctly with a minimal diff, documentation-checked, then runs the project's own gate (lint/typecheck/test/build) and reports the result with evidence. Does not refactor opportunistically or expand scope. |
| **atlas:verifier** | Adversarial verifier: independently confirms or refutes a claimed finding or fix in a fresh context by re-reading the cited lines, re-running the test, or re-querying the data. Defaults to skeptical. Never fixes; only verifies and returns a verdict with evidence. |
| **atlas:completeness-critic** | Pre-done completeness auditor: hunts for unverified claims, unread sources, unexercised paths, and unsatisfied requirements from the original ask; returns a prioritized gap list and refutes "done" if any load-bearing gap remains. Never fixes; only finds and reports. |

Source: `plugins/atlas/agents/explorer.md`, `planner.md`, `implementer.md`, `verifier.md`,
`completeness-critic.md`.

## Documentation Agents

| Agent | One-line role |
|---|---|
| **atlas:docs-curator** | Post-ship docs maintainer: updates `docs/` as the single source of truth after a change lands (CHANGELOG, ROADMAP, AGENTS.md, and affected subfolders), citing file:line evidence for every entry it writes. |
| **atlas:docs-auditor** | Skeptical docs drift auditor: independently checks `docs/` against the actual code and state and returns a per-area verdict (current / stale / missing) with file:line evidence. Never writes; only judges. |

Source: `plugins/atlas/agents/docs-curator.md`, `docs-auditor.md`.

---

## Database Audit Agents

Four read-only agents for structured database audits. Strictly no writes, no migrations, no DDL.
(The former `atlas:api-usage-map` code-usage scanner was removed on 2026-07-07; its responsibility
folds into the domain plugins' own MCP-backed audits. There is no remaining code-usage-map agent.)

| Agent | One-line role |
|---|---|
| **atlas:db-prober** | Read-only DB inspector: queries schema, RLS policies, GRANTs for the runtime role, indexes, constraints, defaults, and EXPLAIN plans; proposes but never applies changes. |
| **atlas:schema-inventory** | PostgreSQL catalog inventory: enumerates tables, columns, types, constraints, indexes, and RLS flags from the live database for the schema half of a DB audit. |
| **atlas:naming-glossary-audit** | Nomenclature auditor: checks PostgreSQL table and column names against a project glossary; focused on user_* to client_* transition or similar rename passes. |
| **atlas:rls-privilege-audit** | RLS security auditor: checks row-level security policies, table grants, and roles against least privilege for the security half of a DB audit in regulated environments. |

Source: `plugins/atlas/agents/db-prober.md`, `schema-inventory.md`,
`naming-glossary-audit.md`, `rls-privilege-audit.md`.

## UX and Frontend Agents

One agent remains in this roster. The dedicated UX test swarm agents (`ux-cartographer`,
`ux-persona`, `ux-fuzzer`, `ux-accuracy-oracle`, `ux-reporter`) were removed on 2026-07-07.
UX/UI test-swarm runs now live solely in the `atlas-ux-test` skill (invoke with
`/atlas-ux-test`); see `plugins/atlas/skills/atlas-orchestrate/references/ux-test-swarm.md` for
the pointer. The `ui-runtime-tester` agent below was not part of the removed swarm and is
retained as a general-purpose browser validation agent used outside the swarm.

| Agent | One-line role |
|---|---|
| **atlas:ui-runtime-tester** | Live browser validator: starts the web app and validates observed behavior (render, clean console, network calls, loading/empty/error/success states) via the Claude_Preview MCP or webapp-testing skill; captures screenshots, console, and network as evidence. Does not edit code. |

## Stack

Verified 2026-07-13 against the shipped tree.

- Language(s): Python 3 (`plugins/atlas/hooks`, `plugins/atlas/scripts`)
- Framework(s): none; code is standard library only, runtime is the Claude Code plugin and
  skill markdown system
- Package manager: none (standard library only); npx used only to run pyright
- Test runner: unittest, via `python3 -m unittest discover`

## Architecture

- Entry points: `plugins/atlas/{hooks,scripts,skills,agents,mcp}` (hook handlers, CLI scripts,
  21 skills, 12 agents, 4 MCP servers)
- Boundaries: `atlas` plugin (codebase-facing, 12 agents in `plugins/atlas/agents/`) versus
  `armada` plugin (11 department agents in `plugins/armada/agents/`); the split landed in v5.0.0
- Key modules: 21 skills under `plugins/atlas/skills/`, 12 agents under `plugins/atlas/agents/`,
  hook handlers under `plugins/atlas/hooks/`, CLI scripts under `plugins/atlas/scripts/`, MCP
  servers under `plugins/atlas/mcp/`

## Conventions

- The single source of truth for project documentation lives under `docs/`. `.atlas/` never
  contains a `docs/` subdirectory: it is reserved for atlas's own self-improvement, evidence,
  findings, `.run/` state, and audits (`.atlas/evidence/`, `.atlas/audits/`, `.atlas/.run/`).
- Every claim cites file:line.
- Every completion carries its evidence in the same message.
- The `.atlas/.run/` directory is ephemeral and gitignored.

## Commands

Verified 2026-07-13. Run from repo root.

- Build: none (no compile step; Python is interpreted)
- Test: `python3 -m unittest discover -s plugins/atlas/hooks` (423 tests, OK as of 2026-07-13)
  and `python3 -m unittest discover -s plugins/atlas/scripts` (510 tests, OK)
- Lint: `ruff check plugins/atlas/hooks plugins/atlas/scripts` (All checks passed)
- Typecheck: `npx pyright plugins/atlas/hooks plugins/atlas/scripts` (0 errors, 0 warnings,
  0 informations)
- Run: load the `atlas` plugin in Claude Code; invoke skills with `/atlas:<skill-name>` or the
  Skill tool

## Agent Constraints

All 12 agents share three standing constraints regardless of the task:

1. **Never fix what you are auditing.** Auditor, verifier, critic, oracle, and prober agents
   return findings only. They do not carry Write, Edit, or MultiEdit permissions.
2. **Cite file:line for every claim.** A finding without a location is not actionable and will be
   rejected by the completeness-critic.
3. **Fail fast, report back.** If a required input is missing (a path that does not exist, a DB
   credential that is absent, a route that does not render), the agent reports the blocker rather
   than guessing.
